But we can go to the zoo anywhere, Mona.
Leo, what's something we can only see in this city?
Well, you're in luck.
The Lantern Festival parade is on tomorrow.
It's very colourful.
Is it near the harbour?
I'd love to see the harbour.
We have harbours in Australia, Mona.
Now, what did you have in mind?
The Lantern Festival parade is on tomorrow.
Perhaps this will interest you.
It's a dolphin watch harbour cruise.
How much will that set us back, Leo?
As you can see, the price is very reasonable.
Oh this looks good.
It's going to be fine and sunny tomorrow.
Perfect for a cruise.
I think I'd like to see the parade.
You can do both!
The cruise takes four hours and the parade doesn't start until after sunset.

All right. Let's go over our itinerary.
We'll take the morning cruise and then have lunch at the quay.
After that, we can visit the temples or you can come back and rest, depending on how you feel.
Yes, let's play that by ear.
At six we'll have a traditional dinner and then go to the parade.
Excellent.
What time should we start out?
We should leave the hotel at about 7.30.
Don't forget to bring your camera and it's a good idea to wear warm clothes.
It can get quite chilly on the ferry.
Don't forget to bring your camera… and it's a good idea to wear warm clothes.

There's a kiosk on the ferry but I can ask the kitchen to make up something to take with you if you prefer.
Thanks Leo, some sandwiches would be great.
I'll make the arrangements now.
See you in the lobby at 7.30.

I mean your wife and kids!
Oh, I'm not married.
Oh really?
Excuse me, Mona, Leo?

Mona, I think I might walk down to the beach.
Tell me about the moon, Leo.
Well, the legend goes…that there's an old man on the moon…
Tell me about the moon, Leo.
Well, the legend goes that there's an old man on the moon who has the names of all the newborn babies.
He knows who will marry whom.
Look around you.
People are making wishes to him.
It's said that he will grant your wish.
Really? That's interesting.
Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I have been so rude to you.
Not at all.
No, I have been rude.
You've been patient and wise and brave
It's nice of you to say so.

Leo, where's my father?
Your father
I can't see him anywhere.
Why weren't you watching?
Excuse me!
He's not here!
We must call the police.
That may not be necessary.
Your father is a very smart man, Ms.White.
I'm sure he knows his way back.
Let's check the hotel first.
Lesson 21: Dealing with a situation
Excuse me, Justine?
Ms.White, from Room 311, would like to speak to you.
Certainly. How can I help you, Ms.White?
My father is missing.
Your receptionist lost him!

I can see this is very serious.

It must be very upsetting for you, Ms.White.
May I suggest you come to my office?

I was their tour guide.
I see.
So what you are saying is that you were separated from your father?
Yes.
Had you arranged a meeting place, Leo?
Yes I had.
But that's where we were standing when we lost him.
Is your father elderly, Ms.White?

And you are Ms.White's father?

Can I just say that you have a very good worker in Leo.
He's been more than helpful.
Hasn't he, Mona?
Oh, I'm sorry I blamed you, Leo but I was very upset.
Maybe, we should all go to the lounge and calm down.
Thank you for your kind invitation, Ms.White, but I must go home now.
And I must go to the Pearl Garden Cabaret.

Leo, this laundry bill seems too much.
Let me see.
Hmm.
That's for emergency dry cleaning.
I can't remember any dry cleaning.
Repairs to your hat, Ms White.
Sixty dollars?
It was cleaned at very short notice and on a holiday.
However, I can query it if you like.
No, that's OK.

And what do you see as your weaknesses?
Do you mean, what am I not so good at?
Yes.
Now, Bob, I'm going to ask you a hypothetical question.

Do you mean, like the Legendary Leo, who jumped into shark infested waters to save a guest's hat?
Something like that.
If I must.
I don't think you would be expected to show that level of enthusiasm, Bob.
Leo was an exceptional worker, but very impetuous.
In that case, I would make sure I know the health and safety requirements associated with my position and follow hotel procedures.
Very good.
Now, is there anything you would like to ask me?
Yes, I was wondering if anyone has heard what happened to Leo?
I mean questions relating to this position, Bob.
Oh, of course.
Um Yes, I would like to know if the hours of duty are flexible.
Yes, we have three shifts, and there is also overtime work available when we're very busy.
That's good.
I'm very impressed with your qualifications Bob.
We'll ring you and let you know the outcome tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Goodbye.

ARCHITECTURAL SYMBOLS
The Palace's design reflects the ways in which its architect Ngô Viết Thụ took inspiration from his knowledge of symbolic concepts derived from Eastern philosophy.
The building's overall structural plan is a rendering of an ancient Ideogram , meaning 'good fortune'.
The front elevation's openings kõu, symbolise truthful speech.
The placing of the flagstaff zhõng, symbolises 'unswerving fidelity'.
Three horizontal strokes illustrated by the roofing, fâcde and canopy sãn, symbolise the mystical triad humanity, wisdom and firmness of purpwe.
The three strokes united by a vertical with the flag situated above forms a character zhũ, signifying the power of the head of state.
The lines along the fâcde xìng, signify ‘prosperity’.
INDEPENDENCE PALACE
Declared a National Site in 1076, then Special National Site in 2009, the Independence Palace, which was first opened to the public in 1990, has been the scene of many of the most important and dramatic events in Viet Nam’s history.
Today’s Palace occupies the site of the former residence of the French colonial Governors General, designed by Achille-Antoine Hermitte and completed in 1871.
Following the 1945 Geneva Accords, the old structure, renamed Independence Palace, became the residence of the first President of the new Sai Gon Republic Ngo Dinh Diem, After a bomb attack on 27 February 1962, President Diem’s assassination in 1963.His successor Nguyen Van Thieu assumed the presidency in October 1967 and occupied the Palace until his abdication on 21 April 1975, when he has replaced by his Vice President Tran Van Huong, and then a week later by General Duong Van Minh.
On 30 April 1975, Liberation Forces antered the Palace grounds and raised the flag of liberation for the first time from its rooftop. General Duong Van Minh offerd his unconditional surrender. Victory had come. The liberation of the South had been achieved.
CABINET ROOM
The meetings held in this room induded sittings of the President and his minisfers.
By decree of President Thiệu in November 1967, the government consisted of the Prime Minister, 19 cabinet mintetefs and 7 deputy ministers.
From 1967 to 1975, there were 5 Cabinet reshuffles.
The longest was General Trln Thiện Khiêm, who remained in office for 6 years. The last serving cabinet and its Prime Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu were appointed on 29 April 1975 and were in the process of being formally presented to the President on 30 April at 10 am at the moment when radio Sàì Gòn was broadcasting President Dương Văn Minh’s statement of surrender confirming the end of hostilities and the transfer of power to the Provisional Revolutiomry Government of the Republic of South Việt Nam,
THE BOMBING OF THE PALACE
On 8 April 1975, an underground member of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Lieutenant Nguyễn Thành Trung, who had infiltrated the airforce of the Southern Republic, seized the opportunity provided by his assignment to fly a military mission to Phan Thiết.
Evading detection by the local control tower, Lt.Trung flew his F5E aircraft directly over Sài Gòn and succeeded in dropping two bombs on the Palace before landing at an improvised airstrip prepared by the Liberation Forces.
The helipad on the upper terrace of the Palace and the main central staircase were damaged in the attack, though they were subsequently repaired .
But this feat seriously undermined the republic's authority and prompted the US President to order the evacuation of the last of the Americans still in Sài Gòn.
CONFERENCE HALL
Receptions for as many as 500 guests were held in this room, which was also used for the installation of each new Cabinet.
At 19:30 on 21 April 1975, President Thiệu delivered his resignation speech ỉn this room: he spoke for over 2 hours about the country's situation in the wake of the Americans' decision to discontinue their support.
Vice President Trần Văn Hương then succeeded to the Presidency, pledging to continue the struggle “to the bitter end” He resigned just a week later, and was replaced by General Dương Văn Minh, from whom the revolutionary authorities received the formal declaration of surrender.
In November 1975, the Consultative Council for National Reunification used this room for its deliberations.
Today it is used for official receptions and other important events.
STATE BANQUETING HALL
State banquets with as many as 100 guests were held in this room.
One of the most notable such events was the inauguration dinner of President Nguyên Văn Thiệu and his Vice President Nguyễn Cao Kỳ on 31 October 1967.
The last State Dinner was held here by President Thiệu on 1 March 1975 for the us congressional delegation sent to report on the prospects for continued support for the southern government.
The room's gold colour scheme was intended to create a convivial atmosphere.
Its focal point is the massive painting in 7 sections by the Palace's architect Ngô Viết Thụ representing a scene from a poem in Chinese characters widely known and cherished as an evocation of national unity.
Its opening lines are "The land is as lovely as a length of brocade, all its growing thing's ripening in peace".
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBER
This room was used for meetings between the President and his senior officers and US advisers.
The walls are hung with maps documenting the war situation in the South.
On 25 March 1975 at 9:30am, faced with the continuing advance of the liberation forces, President Thiệu ordered his senior General Ngô Quang Trưởng to evacuate the city of Huế and mount a last-ditch defence at Đà Nẵng.
This prompted us President Gerald Ford to dispatch the last of the many fact-finding missions sent to report on the situation in the South.
On 3 April 1975, the delegation assembled in this room for a meeting with President Thiệu and his senior military leaders, seeking unsuccessfully to find a solution to the military impasse confronting them.
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
Nguyễn Văn Thiệu was born in 1923 in Tri Thủy village, Ninh Hải district, Ninh Thuận province.
He was trained at the national officer's school at Đà Lạt and subsequently in the USA and France.
Having taken part in the coup d’état tat against President Diệm in November 1963, he made a rapid rise to power, becoming Prime Minister with the associated portfolios of Minister of Defence and National Assembly President, then President of the Southern Republic in 1967.
Thiệu wrote to the US President on 25 March 1975 appealing for an air assault against the arIas under the control of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Forces and for continuing American support for the Southern Republic. His appeal was rejected.
He resigned on 21 April 1975 and then fled the country. He died in Boston, USA, in 2001.
PRESIDENTIAL RECEPTION ROOMS
In the first of the two presidential reception rooms, the President's chair is placed on a platform in front of a striped panel symbolising the flag of the Republic of Việt Nam.
Facing the President's throne-like seat is a chair intended for the guest of honour.
Both are carved with dragon's head motifs.
The other chairs are carved with a phoenix head or characters symbolising longevity.
The second room is considerably simpler.
Between 19 and 23 October 1972, six meetings were held in this room between President Thiệu and Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's National Security Advisor, during which Kissinger sought to persuade President Thiệu to accept the agreement which was eventually enacted as the Paris Peace Accords of January 1973.
AMBASSADORS CHAMBER
Before 1975, many countries had embassies in Sài Gòn.
Newly arrived ambassadors presented their credentials to the President in this room in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The furnishings and pictures in the room are in fine Japanese-style lacquer-work, created by the artist Nguyễn Văn Minh.
The larger painting in 40 small panels entitled "Declaration of victory over the Ming” depicts a famous scene from the reign of King Lê Lợi.
The wall sconces were lit during ambassadorial presentation ceremonies.
On 18 April 1975 at 11:30am, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu received the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador, Hiroshi Hitomi. This was the last such ceremony ever enacted in the Independence Palace.
FIRST LADY’S RECEPTION ROOM
The President's wife held receptions here, often entertaining the wives of visiting heads of State and leaders of various national and international organisations.
The lamps in the shape of flowers give the room a sense of peace and charm.
The décor features a distinctive pairing of two contrasting motifs: the three porcelain figures representing the traditional Gods of Happiness, Prosperity and Longevity and an abstract fresco in modem cubist style.
The wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, Mrs.Nguyễn Thị Mai Anh, was bom in 1930 in Mỹ Tho in Tiền Giang province, to a family of Catholic doctors.
She married Nguyễn Vãn Thiệu in 1951, when he was a serving army lieutenant; they had three children, a daughter, Nguyễn Thị Tuấn Anh and two sons, Nguyễn Quang Lộc and Nguyên Thiệu Long.
SALON OF THE 4 CARDINAL DIRECTIONS
This room "of the 4 cardinal directions of peace" was also known as the meditation room, and was intended by the architect Ngô Viết Thụ as a space in which the head of State would find the calm necessary to reflect with due care before taking decisions determining the country's future.
President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu transformed this space intended for meditative contemplation into a party room with space for the entertainment of 100 or more guests.
The dance floor was constructed from high-quality hard-wood and the windows were constructed from blast-proof glass 12mm in thickness.
On 30 April 1975 at 11:30am, Lieutenant Bùi Quang Thận raised the flag of the Provisional Revolutionary Government from the flagpole above this room, having first taken down the flag of the newly dissolved Republic of Việt Nam.
BUNKER
Designed by the Lt.Col.Phan Văn Điển, the construction of the Presidential bunker took 3 months.
72.5m long, 0.8 to 22.5m in width and with a depth of 0.6 to 2.5m, the rooms are linked by narrow passages and protected by reinforced concrete walls.
It consists of two sections.
The command centre has a depth of 0.6m and is protected by a concrete wall capable of resisting a 500kg blast.
Its telecommunication equipment was installed by the Americans in the 1960s.
The maximum security shelter; at a depth of 2.5m, has a blast wall capable of resisting explosions of up to 2,000kg.
A staircase gave the President direct access to the shelter from his 2nd-floor office.
During the bombing of the Palace on 8 April 1975 the President's whole family took refuge in the shelter.
COMMAND CENTRE
This heavily shielded area was used as an intelligence coordination centre.
The maps provided an overview of on-going military operations.
Map of Việt Nam (1) shows the country divided at the 17th Parallel as provided for by the 1954 Geneva Accords which partitioned the country into the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam in the North, and the Republic of Việt Nam in the South.
Map of South-Việt Nam (2) shows the famous supply network known as the Hồ Chí Minh Trail. The areas thought to be used as bases by the revolutionary forces are shown in orange.
This information was provided by aerial photography with further corroboration from secret intelligence operatives.
Map of North-Việt Nam (3) shows military activities in the northern military zones.
The room also displays a top secret RVN document (4) entitled: "Military Allied Personnel Statistics for 1968"
COMMUNICATIONS
This was the Palace's main receiving station for coded intelligence messages; it could also be used for national radio broadcasts in times of emergency. It could accommodate 41 staff including telegraphists, telex clerks and mobile radio operators whose task was to maintain contact with troop units in the field as well as communication with overseas embassies and diplomatic missions.
In 1968, an emergency national radio service transmitter was instilled in the Palace, initially to broadcast to the area around Sài Gòn - Gia Định, then enhanced with the addition of two l0 kw transmitters allowing for broadcasts to the whole of the Delta and Central Region, A 45m antenna was erected in the Palace garden.
Radio contact with Washington and other overseas contact with Wanshington and other overseas capitals was maintained via relay stations established at Phú Lâm in Sài Gòn.
KITCHEN
This was the kitchen for major event such as the banquet marking the inauguration of President Thiệu, as well as National Day celebrations and state banquet for distinguished visitors, H also provided for grand family occasions such as the wedding of thfe President’s daughter, The kitchen was furnished with what was the most luxurious of modern equipment, of a standard fit for a five-star hotel.
Among the more notable appliances the kitchen contained a massive freezer, elaborate smoke extractors above the oven, and a scale for weighing provisions with a capacity of up to 100kg.
On the mezzanine level on the left-hand fide of the Palace, there was a smaller kitchen to provide for the everyday requirements of the President and his family.

Will cuisine or marine tourism be the core of Vietnam tourism?
Building marine tourism brand or selecting culinary art as the core values of the Vietnamese tourism is still a matter of controversy.
At a recent seminar on building the strategy on brand development for Vietnam's tourism to 2025, with the vision to 2030, many experts contributed ideas to improve the competitiveness of Vietnam's tourism in the integration period.
Tourism brands
According to Le Tuan Anh, Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Department, Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, an important factor to influence the attraction of tourists is not the symbol or slogan but the value of tourism brand.
Many countries around the world have made great progress in the number of tourists thanks to success in branding construction.
For instance, the UK with the brand “Great Britain” built in 2012, which helped this country reach a new record of foreign tourists, with 34.4 million in 2014.
Adjacent to Vietnam, Thailand is also a good example for the development of successful tourism brand "Land of Smiles" associated with the logo "Amazing Thailand".
From 19 million of foreign visitors in 2011, the number of tourists to Thailand grew to 33 million in 2015.
There are many other countries that their tourism brands have been shaped and disseminated worldwide.
To describe American tourism in short words, travelers would say “quality”, for Japanese tourism, it will be “respect, meticulous”, for Italy it will be “romantic”.
In Southeast Asia, referring to Indonesia, people will think of the country with thousands of islands and resorts, for Malaysia, it is famous for shopping tourism, and Cambodia with cultural heritage.
Building brand for Vietnam’s tourism
In the development strategy of Vietnam's tourism brand to 2025 and the vision to 2030, the national tourism brand is defined to be associated with four product lines: sea and islands, culture, nature and urban.
Le Quoc Vinh, General Director of LeBros Media Group, said once the brand is identified, it is important how to market it.
Vinh also pointed out common mistakes in marketing destination brands: it is marketing to all and the use of common, trite language.
"We often focus on promoting the features of the destinations and forget the core factor - emotion," Vinh said, adding that Vietnam’s tourism advertising videos only tried to show off all landscapes of the countries, without creating the highlight or a clear message.
Some travel experts said to successfully build destination branding, Vietnam must find a core value, which must be a unique value, which makes Vietnam different from other countries in the region.
Vinh suggested: "Philip Kotler, the world famous marketing expert said that Vietnam is the kitchen of the world.
Therefore, the cuisine is one of the values that we can use to promote national tourism image."
Building the road of cuisine is also one of the objectives in the strategy to build Vietnam’s tourism brand.
According to tourism experts, the representative image of Vietnam’s tourism include:
1. Ha Long Bay (75%)
2. Hanoi (67%)
3. Food (63%)
4. Hoi An (58%)
5. HCM City (58%)
6. Mekong Delta (54%)
7. Hue (46%)
8. Ao Dai (Vietnamese traditional gown) (33%)
9. Sapa (29%)
10 Nha Trang (29%)
Cuisine of the Nung
The Nung live at higher elevations and have a tradition of self-sufficiency.
The Nung live close to nature and eat whatever they can grow or gather in the forest.
Some of their dishes have become specialties of Lang Son’s tourism.
The Nung grow both regular rice and glutinous rice.
Steamed rice is the main food in the daily meal, which also includes wild vegetables and beans.
In the summer they often have porridge for lunch.
The Nung prefer to fry vegetables and roots rather than boil them.
After frying, they may add water to make soup.
Nung cuisine is well represented by their typical New Year feast, which is considered a meal to counteract risks.
The year-end party of the Nung Phan Sinh in Lang Son province includes many dishes made from different kinds of meat, bamboo shoots, and vegetables.
Luong Van Bach, a Nung man who lives in Lang Son, said: “The Nung Phan Sinh in Lang Son have upheld their traditional New Year celebration.
They prepare various dishes that include duck.
They believe eating duck will banish bad luck and they will enjoy a lucky New Year.”
Duck is part of several different dishes. The most popular dish is duck with sour bamboo shoots.
Khau nhuc is a kind of braised pork belly seasoned with several kinds of herbs, such as cinnamon, anise, pepper, chili, and basil.
Khau nhuc is always served to guests and at parties for weddings, funerals, and longevity celebrations.
Seasoned with leaves of “mac mat”, a local sweet and aromatic plant, roasted duck and pork are two other popular dishes of the Nung and other ethnic groups in Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Bac Can province.
Nong Van Chi of Lang Son said: “Mac mat leaves are indispensable with roasted pork and duck.
The leaves are aromatic.
We also stuff “mac mat” fruit inside a suckling pig to bring out its flavor.”
Rice wine is always part of a festival, wedding, funeral, or birthday party.
The Tay, Nung, and Thai groups in northern provinces drink wine with their arms intertwined to show they will remain close to each other forever.
Over the years, Nung culture and cuisine have become tourism trademarks of Lang Son province.

Banh com – a fine treat of Hanoi
Hanoi is famous for its speciality green rice flake cakes which are sold in Hang Than street.
Hang Than is just among more than 20 culinary streets in Hanoi which has about 70 streets with their first name of Hang.
This 300 metre long street houses more than 30 green rice flake cake shops.
The Nguyen Ninh trademark is the oldest and most popular brand for green rice flake cake.
The name was established in 1865 by late Tran Thi Luan and adopted it’s current name of Nguyen Ninh in 1928.
There have been 5 generations of Nguyen Ninh making green rice flake cake so far, said Nguyen Thi Hiep, a fourth generation family member.
As explained, Nguyen means origin, Ninh is called after Yen Ninh village which is now Yen Ninh street, near Hang Than.
Therefore, Nguyen Ninh green rice flake cake means the cake originated from Yen Ninh village.
Nguyen Ninh’s secret of making the cake is its pure ingredients without additives and mixture.
Green rice flake cake is made of green rice flakes, green peas and sugar.
Green rice flakes must be from Vong and Lu villages (in the past) or from rice land of Thai Binh (at present) and green peas are carefully selected in Ha Tay province.
As tasting a green rice flake cake, especially made by Nguyen Ninh, one can experience the full flavour of simple villages, a very different and typical Hanoi speciality.
The Nung hamlets in Chi Lang, Lang Son
Tourists visiting the northern province of Lang Son are greatly impressed by the peaceful hamlets of the Nung dotting the valleys, hillsides, and river banks.
To Tuan introduces a Nung hamlet in Chi Lang commune. A Nung hamlet in Chi Lang district, Lang Son province
Chi Lang district, which is about 120 km northeast of Hanoi, covers dangerous terrain in a hard-to-access part of Lang Son province.
The Nung are the majority residents in all 19 communes of Chi Lang district.
Trieu Thuy Tien, an official working in Lang Son’s culture sector, says that, like the Nung in other localities, the Nung in Chi Lang have maintained their traditions and customs: “The Nung clans cluster in hamlets.
They share with the Kinh people a tendency to treasure their neighbors above distant relatives.
Relatives living far away are not as valuable as good people living next door who will give us whatever we ask for.
It shows a sense of mutual support in a close-knit community.”
The Nung prefer to live at high elevations.
On national highway 1A, we see a road sign that reads “Ai Chi Lang”, where we turn into a rough road that climbs up the mountain to the Nung area. 40 km later we arrive at Co Hương, Thằm Nà, and Suối Mạ hamlet, about 1,200 to 1,300 meters above sea level.
Our effort is rewarded with beautiful vistas of vast meadows where herds of goats and horses are grazing.
The Nung are often praised for their openness and warm welcome for strangers. Their lifestyle and cooking also make a good impression on visitors.
In recent years, besides their tradition of raising cattle, the Nung have grown cash crops and fruit trees.
In the 1980s some households piloted growing custard-apple trees.
Now it has become the main fruit tree which brings them a stable income.
Triệu Thị Nhất, a Nung woman in Chi Lăng commune, says: “My family grows rice, custard-apples, and raises cattle.
Our income comes mainly from growing custard-apples.
We can afford to build a new house and buy some home comforts.”
Social changes have affected the Nung community.
There are many new brick houses replacing earthen stilt houses.
One thing that has not changed is their tradition of unity and mutual support to escape poverty and become better-off.
What is Vietnam's tourism identity?
To describe American tourism in short words, travelers would say “quality”, for Japanese tourism, it will be “respect, meticulous”, for Italy it will be “longing, romantic and luxury”.
What words could be used to describe Vietnam’s tourism?
This was the question of Mr.Le Tuan Anh, Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Department of the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) at a seminar held at the Hanoi International Tourism Fair 2016.
"Vietnam’s tourism has never been able to touch the human heart like Thailand," said Le Quoc Vinh, CEO of Le Bros media group.
Citing a clip advertising Thai tourism in the modern style, entitled ihatethailand (I hate Thailand), which attracted millions of views on the social network, Vinh said that it is important to "find the brand soul" rather than just focusing on developing the brand reputation and brand communication.
Vietnam’s tourism promotional activities have only advertised landscapes while ignoring the core, the highest element of the brand – emotion, Vinh said.
In the strategic project on development of tourism products of Vietnam to 2025 and the vision to 2030, the logo and slogan of Vietnam’s tourism remained unchanged.
"The matter is not in the logo or the slogan because they do not create the value.
We have to convey the brand's values," said Le Tuan Anh.
"Eco-tourism is developed everywhere, but visitors do not think it is eco-tourism.
This affects the image of Vietnam’s tourism," said Ms. Do Thi Thanh Hoa, Deputy Director of the Institute of Tourism Development.
Vietnam's tourism brand to 2020, according to Hoa, must be marine and island tourism.
The subject of the Hanoi International Tourism Fair 2016 is also "Vietnam, the paradise of marine and island tourism".
"Compared with other countries with marine brand in the region, Vietnam still has many advantages thanks to the system of beautiful beaches, crystal sea water and smooth sand," said Hoa.
Nevertheless, representatives of some travel firms said all coastal provinces wanted to develop marine tourism but many beaches were still flooded by rubbish.
City tourism in Vietnam is not mentioned much, because Vietnam cannot compete with Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, with big cities and developed shopping tourism.
However, this is still seen as one of four typical products of the country's tourism in the future.
"The most important factor is the nuance, which makes Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang always the top three most attractive cities to foreign visitors in Vietnam," said Le Tuan Anh.
Many suggested that international visitors highly appreciate the culture, cuisine, friendly people, and daily life experience in Vietnam.
Street food of Vietnam like pho (noodles), nem ran (spring rolls), and banh mi have become famous worldwide.
Many world leading travel magazines also praised Vietnam’s food, even used the word "superpower".
Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh once said "it is very bad if we do not promote Vietnam cuisine."
Colin Pine, CEO of Ho Tram Resort, a member of the Tourism Advisory Council, said it was necessary to research and clarify further the tourism brand of Vietnam.
"Vietnam has many special things.
The difference in climate and culture of the three regions is also an advantage to attract foreign travellers.
I personally have lived in Vietnam for more than 20 years because of the friendly people," he said.

The 7 natural wonders of Phu Yen
Mossy beaches, slender wooden bridges and countless ponds and streams in the coastal province of Phu Yen have been sights to behold since forever.
Phu Yen sits 561 kilometers to the north of Saigon, right above the famous Khanh Hoa Province that gave us the fabulous Nha Trang and its beaches.
Its seaside location offers a beauty that rivals fantasy film sets, and its low-profile status keeps it safe from the forces of mass tourism that have saturated many attractions.
Hybrid cohabitation between moss and sea defenses.
Moss, one of the most trustworthy indicators of time, finds perfect harmony covering the concrete embankments by the sea in Phu Yen.

Said to be the longest of its kind in Vietnam at 700 meters, from afar the bridge belies the weight it can carry.
La Vong fish - a favourite dish of Hanoian
The food is supposed to have been created by the Doan family.
According to Ngo Thi Tinh, a descendant of the 4th generation of the family, the family started the business of selling "cha ca" to earn money to support the family members and to have a meeting place for the Vietnamese people who wanted to fight against French colonialism.
The family food became a speciality of Hanoian people.
The grilled fish must be made from a kind of fresh water fish called hemibagrus because it has very few bones and the flesh is very tasty.
If hemibagrus is not available, we could make do with mudfish or snake-head fish.
Some connoiseurs may request for a special kind of fish called Anh Vu, which is available only in Viet Tri city at the turning point of the Bach Hac River.
Thin slices of Anh Vu fish are rolled with a kind of herb called "soi" then grilled to give an excellent flavour.
To make grilled fish, thin slices of fish have to be mixed with ginger, saffron, fermented cold rice, pepper and fish sauce; then placed on bamboo skewers and grilled on a burning charcoal stove right on the dinning tables.

8 interesting facts about Da Lat
Da Lat is not only a renowned tourist-resort city of Vietnam but also famous for unusual and interesting sites.
1. Linh Phuoc – the Buddhist temple of records
Linh Phuoc, located at 120 Trai Mat, Da Lat, is one of the most well-known pagodas in Vietnam with a 37-metre bell tower – the tallest in the country.
The main hall consists of colorful paintings regarding the story of Buddha from his birth until he obtained Nirvana and his death.
Linh Phuoc Pagoda, also called Ve Chai Pagoda, was built from debris of glass, pottery bowls and porcelain between 1949 and 1952 in a remote residential area of Da Lat City.
The pagoda is led by many Buddhist monks and was renovated by Monk Thich Tam Vi in 1990.
The pagoda has been managed by 4 Buddhist monks, including Mr.Thich Minh The (1951 – 1954), Mr.Thich An Hoa (1954 – 1956), Mr.Thich Quang Phat (1956 – 1959) and Mr.Thich Minh Duc (1959 – 1985).
Since 1985, Mr.Thich Tam Vi has managed the pagoda including a big restoration in 1990.
The remarkable feature of the pagoda is the Dragon - shaped design made from the broken pieces of glasses in accordance to the design of Khai Dinh's Tomb in Hue. In the main temple, there is a statue of Shakyamuni Buddhist with the height of 4.9m, sitting under the root of Bodhi tree.
Beside the pagoda, we can see a 49m Dragon flying around the garden.
In front of the sanctum, there is Da Bao tower with 27m height.
On two sides of the tower, bell and drum are put.
In the tower, there are some statues of Quan The Am Bodhisattva.

2. The nuclear reactor
This is the only nuclear reactor in Indochina, which is located at No.1 Nguyen Tu Luc, Da Lat city.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Da Lat nuclear reactor has small capacity (500kW) but it works safely and at high economic efficiency.
The Da Lat Nuclear Reactor, formerly known as TRIGA Mark II reactor, was built in 1963 with the authorized maximum operation power level of 250kWt, but it ceased operation from 1968 to 1975.
With support from the former Soviet Union, Vietnam began to restore and expand the reactor in February 1982 and officially resumed operation on March 20, 1984, allowing a peak pulse power of 500 kWt.
Da Lat is expected to build a new 15MWt reactor in the future.
3. Da Quy (wild sunflower) Theatre
This is a special architectural work of Da Lat, which is located at the Lam Vien Da Lat Square.
4. Crazy House
Covering an area of approximately 1,600 square meters, Hang Nga Guest House, also known as “Crazy House”, is design by Vietnamese architect Dang Viet Nga.
As the intention of the architect is to make a fairy tale house, the “crazy house” resembles a tree with uneven windows, and tunnel-shaped stairways.
Both the exterior and the interior of the guesthouse are created and decorated with twisting organic forms and very few right angles.
The hollow “tree” extends in many directions, rising above to reach the sky of the amazing Da Lat.
Walking along the cave-shape hallways inside the house is not simply a visit but an exhilarating experience-a departure from the norm, wild mushrooms and spider webs popping up on your way is not unusual.
The guesthouse is a spectacular construction with ten themed guest rooms such as the tiger room, the eagle room, the ant room and the kangaroo room with decorations and handcrafted furniture matching the theme.
The guest house is famous among international tourists.
5. Da Lat clay sculpture tunnel
A kilometer long path snaking through a red basaltic soil hill with sculptures carved out of its sides is set to become a popular tourist attraction in Da Lat.
Located near the famous Tuyen Lam Lake, the path embodies the vision of its founder Trinh Ba Dung to tell the history of the city in a uniquely creative way.
Sculptures on the walls of the path purport to tell the story of Da Lat from more than 100 years ago, when the area was wild and teeming with wildlife, when it was sparsely inhabited by the Co Ho ethnic minority.
Various Co Ho myths including the fleeing of the father tortoise and his children while the mother tortoise fights a huge snake are etched into the wall.
The story indicates that the Co Ho were a matriarchal society.
The French colonial days are indicated with sculptures of landmark buildings like the Da Lat College, Da Lat Railway Station, Pasteur Institute and old villas by the Xuan Huong Lake.
The highest sculpture on the walls is 12m tall.
Work on this complex began in 2010 and more than 100 artisans were on the site during its busiest times.
The first work was a 90sq.m house made of soil, furnished with beds, chairs, tables, wardrobes, washing basins and chimneys, which are all made of soil.
The house stands against a mountain and faces the lake.
There is a map of Vietnam on its roof.
The house was recognized as "The First and the Most Unique House Made of Basaltic Soil without Baking" by the Vietnam Record Book Centre in 2013.
The complex won a Green Architecture Award from the Vietnam Architects Association in 2014.
6. The only white flamboyant tree in Vietnam
Da Lat is the home to Vietnam’s only one white flamboyant tree (White Jacaranda).
The tree was brought to Vietnam by Dr.Ha Ngoc Mai in 1998.
The tree is planted in the villa at No.75Phu Dong Thien Vuong Street, Da Lat.
Dr. Mai brought this tree to Vietnam in 1998 from Sydney, Australia.
At that time, an Asian worker at a nursery in Sydney introduced Mai to a violet flamboyant grafted with a mutated white flamboyant tree.
The price for this violet-white tree was $25.
Three years later, the tree began blossoming bunches of white flowers.
The first bunches of white flamboyant yielded several fruits and Dr.Mai cultivated over 50 seedlings from these fruits.
However, they produced violet flowers, not white.
7. Circle Hostel

6 Reasons Why Solo Travel Is So Addictive
Find out why traveling solo is seriously addictive, and no, it isn't just the lower costs when it's all said and done.
The first time you travel solo can be a nerve-wracking experience.
Possibly, for the first time in your life, you only have yourself to rely on.
There’s the little experiences, like not having anyone to look after your bag when you go to the airport bathroom.
Then, there’s the big ones, like finding yourself stranded with nowhere to sleep at midnight, because you’ve been locked out of your hostel.
So why exactly is this so addictive?
Quite simply, because there’s something totally unbeatable about conquering challenges on your own.
About living by the seat of your pants, choosing your own adventures, rules and schedules and being solely accountable for everything that happens.
And that, as all solo travelers know, is the true meaning of freedom.
1. You’ll Learn How To Lead
You’re the director, producer and actor in the movie that is your life, but, in the chaos of everyday moments, this can be hard to remember.
The second you embark on solo travel, you understand the true meaning of being entirely responsible for yourself.
You’re in charge of every decision and there’s nothing more empowering than discovering how capable you are.
2. You’ll Abandon Your Comfort Zones
Traveling solo is always an expansive experience, as it shatters pre-conceived concepts of the world with each step you take into the unknown.
New doors open up at every stop, in a way that’s not always visible when you’re occupied with travel companions.
You’re more inclined to talk to strangers and you’ll notice more people will want to connect with you.
Left to your own devices, you’ll try things you’ve never even considered and your ‘comfort zones’ will soon be a thing of the past.
3. You’ll Get To Reinvent Yourself
At home, you might be the shy one in your group of friends, the one who picks up everyone’s slack, the gardener, the computer whiz or the serious academic.
When you travel solo, no one knows, or cares, about the labels attached to you.
You can become an adventurer, a photographer, a farmer, a diver.
Whatever appeals to you, just take your pick!
You’ll discover things about yourself that haven’t had the space to appear in your busy home life.
The freedom to reinvent yourself and grow, without any input from people you know or past experiences, is seriously addictive in the best possible way.
4. You’ll Learn To Live In The Present Moment
There’s nothing like gazing at an awe-inspiring, foreign landscape on your own and knowing you only have a few, precious moments to soak it in.
You can’t take the landscape home with you and you might not ever return.
Without your friend next to you, chatting your ear off, you become totally immersed in the present moment.
It’s just you and the earth.
Travelling solo gives you the space to truly appreciate each moment, through your eyes alone.
5. You’ll Learn How To Spot Trouble From A Distance
A more attuned ‘trouble radar’ seems to exist for those of us who love to travel on our own.
You have to be more careful about your belongings, about heading out at night and about trusting people.
Because of this, you develop the ability to spot trouble from a distance, before it enters your world.
This is an invaluable skill for future travels and one that’s carried over into your life in general.
6. You’ll Discover What’s Important In Life
“To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the pleasantest sensations in the world.” – Freya
You can forget about expectations and even aspirations that take you away from living life, right now, into a future projection of it.
You can enjoy the simple pleasures of savoring exotic food for as long as you want, basking in the curious smile of a local child and letting your mind run free towards the next destination.
When you return home, all those ‘big’ issues will have faded into oblivion under an avalanche of freedom and aliveness.
You’ll view the world with fresh, empowered eyes.
And that’s the ultimate addiction.
Vietnamese spent $6 billion on overseas tours last year
Favorite destinations included Thailand, Cambodia, Japan and South Korea while local attractions became less appealing
Around six million Vietnamese traveled abroad for holiday last year and spent roughly US$6 billion, according to the Vietnam Tourism Association.
That was significant up from $3.5 billion in 2012, the association said, as cited by local media.
According to tour operators, favorite destinations included Thailand, Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, Europe and the US.
Vietnam’s top tourist companies such as Vietravel and Saigontourist said overseas tours have grown faster than domestic tours.
Vietnam itself is home to many famous destinations, including Ha Long Bay, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Hoi An ancient town, all of which are UNESCO heritage sites.
But poor service quality, high prices and lack of creativity are among the main reasons that local tourists prefer going abroad, experts say.
Meanwhile, many foreign countries such as Japan and South Korea have simplified visa procedures for Vietnamese tourists and offered very competitive tour prices in recent years, they say.
White mountain, Green tourism
The French Alpine town of Chamonix has been a magnet for tourists since the 18th century.
But, today, tourism and climate change are putting pressure on the surrounding environment.
Marc Grainger reports.
The town of Chamonix- Mont-blanc sits in valley at 1,035 metres above sea level in the Haute-Savoie department in south-eastern France.
To the north- west are the red peaks of the Aiguilles Rouges massif; to the south-east are the permanently white peaks of Mont Blanc which at 4,810 metres is the highest mountain in the Alps.
It's a typical Alpine environment, but one that is under increasing strain from the hustle and bustle of human activity
Tourism is Chamonix's lifeblood.
Visitors have been encouraged to visit the valley ever since it was discovered by explorers in 1741.
Over 40 years later, in 1786, Mont Blanc's summit was finally reached by a French doctor and his guide, and this gave birth to the sport of alpinism, with Chamonix at its centre.
In 1924, it hosted the first Winter Olympics, and the cable cars and lifts that were built in the years that followed gave everyone access to the ski slopes.
Today, Chamonix is a modern town, connected to the outside world via the Mont Blanc Road Tunnel and a busy highway network.
It receives up to 60,000 visitors at a time during the silk season, and climbers, hikers and extreme- sports enthusiasts swarm there in the summer in even greater numbers, swelling the town's population to 100,000.
It is the third most visited natural site in the world, according to Chamonix's Tourism Office and, last year, it had 5,2 million visitor bed nights- all this in a town with fewer than 10,000 permanent inhabitants.
The influx of tourists has put the local environment under severe pressure, and the authorities in the valley have decided to take action.
Educating visitors is vital.
Tourists are warned not to drop rubbish, and there are now recycling points dotted all around the valley, from the town centre to halfway up the mountains.
An internet blog reports environmental news in the town, and the “green" message is delivered with all the tourist office's activities.
Low-carbon initiatives are also important for the region.
France is committed to reducing its carbon emissions by a factor of four by 2050.
Central to achieving this aim is a strategy that encourages communities to identify their carbon emissions on a local level and make plans to reduce them.
Studies have identified that accommodation accounts for half of all carbon emissions in the Chamonix valley.
Hotels are known to be inefficient operations, but those around Chamonix are now cleaning up their act.
Some are using low-energy lighting, restricting water use and making recycling bins available for guests; others have invested in huge projects such as furnishing and decorating using locally sourced materials, using geothermal energy for heating and installing solar panels.
Chamonix’s council is encouraging the use of renewable energy in private properties too, by making funds available for green renovations and new constructions.
At the same time, public-sector buildings have also undergone improvements to make them more energy efficient and less wasteful.
For example, the local ice rink has reduced its annual water consumption from 140,000 cubic metres to 10,000 cubic metres in the space of three years.
Improving public transport is another feature of the new policy, as 80 percent of carbon emissions from transport used to come from private vehicles.
While the Mont Blanc Express is an ideal way to travel within the valley- and see some incredible scenery along the route- it is much more difficult to arrive in Chamonix from outside by rail.
There is no direct line from the closest airport in Geneva, so tourists arriving by air normally transfer by car or bus.
However, at a cost of 3.3 million euros year, Chamonix has introduced a free shuttle service in order to get people out of their cars and into buses fitted with particle filters.
If the valley’s visitors and residents want to know why they need to reduce their environmental impact, they just have to look up; the effects of climate change are there for everyone to see in the melting glaciers that cling to the mountains.
The fragility of the Alpine environment has long been a concern among local people.
Today, 70 percent of the 805 square kilometres that comprise Chamonix- Mont-Blanc is protected in some way.
But now, the impact of tourism has led the authorities to recognize that more must be done if the valley is to remain prosperous: that they must not only project the natural environment better, but also manage the numbers of visitors better, so that its residents can happily remain there.
Northern flavors cure homesickness in Saigon
People from Hanoi and Saigon recognize each other as compatriots and share almost everything from their language to their customs, and most certainly their food, despite the 3,000 kilometers that separates them.
Having been in Saigon for more than 20 years, the kiosks at the end of Chu Manh Trinh (District 1), Tran Quoc Toan, Vo Thi Sau and Nguyen Thong Street (District 3) have almost every northern specialty for sale.
Food such as dried bamboo shoots, fragrant mushrooms, arrowroot noodles from Bac Kan and hundreds of specialties all find their way to Saigon, mostly by train.
Food with a short shelf-life like tofu from the famous Mo village in Hanoi, salted pork and hand-ground squid cakes are treated with care and get here by air.
Instant food like the sweet dessert 'che' and sticky rice also secure a seat on the planes that shuttle between the regions.
Hanoi’s square ‘banh chung’ still reigns supreme and takes up the most space.
According to shop owners, despite being brought from the capital, the price here is still not much higher than in Hanoi.
Processed foods such as ground meat cake ‘gio’ and ‘cha’ are also easy to find for northern people living in Saigon.
Not everything sold in these markets is exclusive to the North.
Many shop owners still want their goods to be shipped from their home towns.
Housewives can find all kinds of food that remind them of the scent of Hanoi here like ‘sau’ (dratoncomelon).
Northern style pickles, sauces and pastes are available all year round.
Some shops offer the beer lovers’ favorite snack: ‘banh da’, the thin crunchy crackers riddled with black sesame seeds that has become a part of after-work culture.
Fresh lime leaves, the most important aromatic compliment for the popular boiled chicken, found on every corner in the north but almost nowhere in the south.
Northern fruits are also a good seller.
Everything you need is within reach.
Even if the fruit you are after is not available, a quick phone call will quickly satisfy your craving.

The modest, peaceful village is a popular destination in Hue.
Visitors are charmed by the village’s gardens of centuries-old trees, which have been preserved by the locals as a precious heritage.

Visitors to Phuoc Tich are amazed at its ancient houses.
More than 30 houses in the village are up to a century old.

They are so well preserved as to astonish cultural anthropologists, architects, and historians.
The village’s ancient houses are nha ruong, a kind of residence built with artfully carved wooden pillars and beams.
They are held together with wooden pegs so they can be easily dismantled.
Phuoc Tich houses are made principally of jackfruit wood and are adorned with exquisite carvings, most of which remain undamaged despite having gone through many wars throughout the years.
Most of the ancient houses in the village have large yards full of old trees and separated by rows of tea trees, creating an exotic green space.
Le Trong Dien, the owner of an ancient house in Phuoc Tich, said both the ancient houses and their gardens attract tourists: 
“Phuoc Tich people are hospitable and they want to introduce their houses to others. Phuoc Tich ceramics, trees, and lifestyles are different from elsewhere”.
Visitors are introduced to a unique way of producing ceramic products and may try to work as a ceramic craftsman, just one of the many unforgettable experiences Phuoc Tich provides.
Local people treasure their ceramic making craft and devote a separate area, known as Treng Islet, to preserving ancient ceramic pieces.
They were very expensive and very sought-after.
At that time, our village was rich with many houses.
All children went to school.
Phuoc Tich people began making ceramic products in 1940.
At that time, I was small.
In 1975, I began making ceramic products.
Ruong houses in Phuoc Tich were built with revenues from selling ceramic items”.
Visitors to Phuoc Tich also like the local food specialties, especially the rice cakes made by local women.
Ms Nguyen Thi Thuy, who lives in the village, said local women set up a cooking club to introduce local food to visitors: “Here we serve pickles, pork with shrimp sauce, and a variety of rice cakes.
Our club has 16 members.
By joining the club, local women can earn extra income”.
Tourists to Phuoc Tich often arrange to stay in local houses living with the local people and learning something about their lives.

The State Academic Kuban Cossack Chorus, Russia
The State Academic Kuban Cossack Chorus is the oldest Russian folk chorus, with a history that goes back to 1811.
At that time it was a military choir of the Kuban Cossack Army, based in Ekaterinodar, the capital city of the South Russian province of Kuban, performing mostly in churches during religious services. Later, the Chorus started to give secular stage performances, and its repertoire got broader with classical pieces and folk songs.
For over 200 years now the Chorus has been a symbol and pride of Russian folk art.
The Chorus received highest awards for its great contributions in Russian culture.
It is the only company in Russia that received an honorary title of Ambassador of “SOCHI 2014” Olympics.
The temperament, originality and superior skills of the State Academic Kuban Cossack Chorus have received enthusiastic applauses in many countries as well as much praises from the national and foreign press and prominent figures in arts.

Time Period The scientific inventory was carried out during the following times:
Phase 1: August 25 – September 30, 2010;
Phases 2 and 3: October 5, 2010 – February 30, 2011.
Objectives The scientific inventory had the following objectives:
To survey and assess the situation of the worship of Hùng Kings among Vi?t communities within Phú Thọ province, where the worship of Hùng Kings originated and whence it has been passed on;
To systematically collect data provided by these communities in order to assess the existing situation of material heritage and cultural-religious activities directly related to the Hùng Kings, and draw on these data in planning for the further collection, preservation and promotion of the cultural-heritage values of the worship of Hùng Kings (as it has been carried out on different scales and at different levels for many years);
To collect scientific evidence in accordance with UNESCO’s guidelines and criteria, and later include this evidence in the profile to be submitted to  UNESCO for inscription of the worship of Hùng Kings on the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Locations
Characteristics of Residential Areas and the System of Belief Practice and Festivals Related to the Worship of Hùng Kings
The area comprising all the villages/hamlets in which Hùng Kings worship and festivals related to figures of the Hùng Kings period take place is very  large, covering the eastern, northern and western parts of Phú Thọ province (12 out of 13 districts, towns and cities, and 74 out of 275 communes, wards and towns with 109 villages, hamlets and residential quarters); many of these sites can be found in two central areas, consisting of the communes, wards and towns of Vi?t Trì City and Lâm Thao District.
A unique character is worshipped in each of the belief spaces of nearly all the villages in these 12 districts, towns, and cities of Phú Thọ province.
As a  first step, we focus on the worship of Hùng Kings; later other characters will be examined as additional data relevant to determining the scale of worship.
Selection of Villages for the Scientific Inventory The selection of villages for the scientific inventory was made with attention to the following issues:
On the basis of the Hùng Kings Family Tree, legends, conferments and petition sheets currently kept in the vicinity of Hùng Kings temples and shrines in communes of Lâm Thao District, Vi?t Trì City, as well as Sino-Vietnamese documents held by the Institute of Sino Studies, Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, where titles of Hùng Kings are granted by different feudal dynasties (mostly from the 15th century and later), villages, hamlets and residential quarters worshipping the Hùng Kings are determined by the following criteria:
First, villages, hamlets and residential quarters with worshipping sites dedicated to figures named as Hùng Kings;
Second, villages, hamlets and residential quarters with  worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings under folk names (nicknames or names used because of certain taboos, etc.) such as ?t S?n Thánh V??ng, Vi?n S?n Thánh V??ng, ??t Ng?t Cao S?n and Cao S?n Thánh V??ng;
Third, villages, hamlets and residential quarters with worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings following the two above-mentioned criteria which existed before 1945, although they might no longer have worshipping sites or their worshipping sites are now in ruins, are also considered in  the determination of the cultural space of Hùng Kings worship;
Locations where there are worshipping sites under other names (such as ??c Thánh Sa L?c, ??i V??ng Thọ?ng ??ng Thọn, Hi?n Lang ??i V??ng, Hi?n Công ??i V??ng and ?ông H?i ??i V??ng) are also seen as worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings, and are named in a separate list to be investigated later.
In general, villages, hamlets and residential quarters to be investigated during this inventory are located in a semi-mountainous region where the mountains drop from the southwest (Yên L?p, Thanh S?n, Thanh Thọy, Tam Nông, and C?m Khê districts) to the northeast (Lâm Thao District, Vi?t Trì City, Phù Ninh District, Phú Thọ Town, Thanh Ba, ?oan Hùng, and H? Hòa districts). Around Ngh?a L?nh stand low hills at the centre of the midlands.
Thousands of years ago, this area played a very important economic, social and cultural role, being both the site of the natural development of a community and the site where the Hùng Kings established the capital city of V?n Lang.
One can see that the direction in which the mountains fall – from northwest to southeast – is also the direction in which three major rivers flow – the Thao, the Lô, and the ?à – together contributing to the creation of fertile lands along their banks where communities of farmers developed and at the same time contributing to the formation of the delta.
The main livelihoods of people living within this area have remained almost the same to this day – wet-rice cultivation and animal husbandry.
Archeological evidence collected over the past 50 years shows that people of the ancient cultures of Phùng Nguyên, ??ng ??u, Gò Mun and ?ông S?n built houses, workshops and tombs in this area.
From a geographical-cultural perspective, the Vi?t–M??ng people have a long history.
The society was animistic, worshipping mountain gods, ancestors, tutelary gods and Buddhism.
Historically, Phú Thọ Province lies within the area of settlement and cultural intersection between the countries of V?n Lang and Âu L?c. This area also served as a gate for exchange between the delta area, with the cultures of the northwest, and part of Vi?t B?c (North of Hanoi).
Generations of inhabitants of this area had close political, economic, cultural and social relationships with each other.
The area has a long history of formation  involving   many  important  events related  to  the establishment, development and protection of the country by the ancient Vi?t people together with other ethnic groups.
Research Methods
Research methods included interviews by questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus-group interviews, recording oral histories, and statistics. The research was carried out in a participatory way with respect for community voices, with one of its aims being preservation of history.
An interdisciplinary research approach (including bibliography, archeology, text studies, and museum studies) was also taken for analysis and comparison of different sources of information and determination of the subject of the investigation and inventory.
Difficulties
Over the long history of the area's development, because of natural geological changes and social and economic changes following different administrative structures, many place names have changed with old  names being replaced by new. Knowledgeable people are few, texts have not been transferred sustainably or systematically to younger generations, many administrative places have shifted or been extended, many belief practices and customs have degraded (especially in the period since 1945), and in many cases contemporary culture has supplanted traditional culture.
Gaps have appeared in the generational transfer of traditional culture because of war and other historical-social conditions.
On field trips to the localities, we noticed that many sites associated with the worship of Hùng Kings (communal halls, temples, Buddhist temples, shrines) had been destroyed or seriously damaged.
There are also cases where temples/communal halls have been moved to new sites for restoration, and re- built with new techniques, forms and materials, and as a result have become religiously unattractive or irrelevant to their communities.
In most of the places investigated, the cultural staff and commune managers are young people who have limited capacities and understandings of  traditional culture, do not understand or cannot meet standard requirements of cultural management, and are incapable of helping local people collect, investigate and preserve their heritage.
As a result, many valuable heritage sites which were destroyed or damaged have not received the necessary attention for development of restoration plans or submission of requests for financial support from the authorities.
Since 1996, most residential areas which in the past were villages and hamlets have been changed into numbered residential quarters (Residential Quarter No.1, No.2, No.3, etc.).
Thus, the traditional names of many villages and hamlets which had existed for thousands years, were rooted deeply in the minds of local people and were closely associated with the characteristics and origins of each village/hamlet as well as many other traditional values have been eliminated.
In addition, several large, densely populated villages/hamlets have also been divided into residential quarters.
Now, only in residential quarters where worshipping sites are situated do local people pay much  attention to or know (at differing levels) about the worship.
In other residential quarters, people are much less attached to the belief, and therefore their awareness and sense of responsibility have faded.
In many villages, sites associated with Hùng Kings worship were destroyed (for different reasons) many decades ago, and the worshipping space in some villages/hamlets has been taken over for use by local authorities or individuals.
Thus, in many places it is almost impossible to restore ancient belief activities – a great  loss to the culture.
The worship of Hùng Kings is a cultural activity originating from a dynasty passed on in legends.
All the figures associated with this ancient period over thousands of years of worship by common people have been molded and transformed according to diverse cultural layers and customs.
herefore, even when they exist in the same worshipping space, sometimes it is very difficult  to name the main worshipped figure.
In many places it is difficult to identify worshipped  figures  because  of  ambiguity  and transformation  (due  to hèm customs or perceptions) as well as replacement of figures (between Hùng Kings and related figures).
Due to the limited time allocated to the inventory and limited number of professional staff, the work of data collection together with the community showed certain shortcomings. These shortcomings partly reflect in the results of the inventory and investigation, especially in the evaluation of typical expressions of the heritage and the system of ancient languages which are closely associated with the traditional festivals in particular and cultural activities of the villages/communes in general.
Advantages
During the time carrying out the inventory, the research group received a great deal of support from local authorities, district/commune cultural staff and village heads who worked to create favorable working conditions for the group.
In particular, almost all the hamlet heads and commune cultural staff participated directly in organizing focus-group interviews in the localities, actively addressing issues raised during the interviews and contributing greatly to the production of results from the interviews.
All the local people (especially the elderly people and members of the festival management board) either directly or indirectly participated  in providing information. They were enthusiastic and formed a consensus in  regard to the preservation, promotion and dissemination of Hùng Kings worship and festivals related to the Hùng Kings in their localities.
Many elderly people provided the research group with valuable documents which individuals had collected, complied or translated and which serve well as references for the questionnaires.
Support from members of the heritage site management board and association of elderly people in villages in organizing and facilitating interviews helped the research group a great deal in ensuring the quality of the inventory.
Investigation–Inventory Results
Given the above-mentioned advantages and surmounted difficulties, the research group achieved certain results.
Documents and information provided  by the focus groups and by the questionnaires confirm the diversity, newness and systematicness of documentation and knowledge of Hùng Kings worship and festivals associated with the Hùng Kings in the past and the present.
Cultural-historical heritage sites were identified in 12 districts, towns and cities (C?m Khê, ?oan Hùng, H? Hòa, Lame Theo, Phù Ninh, Tam Nông, Thanh Ba, Thanh S?n, Thanh Thọy and Yên L?p districts, Phú Thọ Town, and Vi?t Trì City) with 109 villages, hamlets and residential quarters being investigated, among which 46 villages and hamlets (in 29 communes, wards and towns) are home to cultural activities and festivals directly related to Hùng Kings worship, and have worshipping sites under the names of the original Hùng Kings or their 18 generations of descendants.
These villages and hamlets with existing heritage sites directly associated with Hùng Kings worship and festivals are mostly situated in Lâm Thao District and Vi?t Trì City.
The existence of a number of festivals directly associated with the worship of Hùng Kings in several villages and hamlets of C?m Khê District (Kh?ng T??c village), Lam Thao District (the two villages of Tr?o and Vi) and Vi?t Trì City (Hùng Lô village) with significant remnants (ponds, drill grounds of Hùng King troops, places where the Kings stopped to visit local people, places where the Kings celebrated the New Year together with villagers, places where the Kings taught people how to cultivate rice, etc.) and a number of ancient place names have provided important data, contributing to the success of the research on the culture and beliefs of the ancient Vi?t – M??ng people.
Together with the above-mentioned sites, there are also 139 sites in 52 communes (76 villages or hamlets) of 12 districts worshipping Hùng Kings under names such as Cao S?n Thánh V??ng, ??t Ng?t Cao S?n, ?t S?n Thánh V??ng and Vi?n S?n Thánh V??ng.
Specific Results from the Investigation-Inventory
The data obtained from the research contain a great deal of information which can be divided into two main groups: quantitative data (obtained using quantitative research methods such as questionnaires and statistics) and qualitative data (obtained using ethnographical methods and oral history recording, etc.)These data reflect on: a.cultural and belief activities and festivals related to the Hùng Kings which took place in the past; b/ cultural and belief activities and festivals related to the Hùng Kings which take place today; c.chief characteristics of these cultural and belief activities; d.the condition of the tangible culture associated with the belief and festival activities; and, e.issues relating to the preservation and promotion of the cultural values of the belief practices and festivals associated with the Hùng Kings in particular and figures of the Hùng King period in general.
Cultural and Belief Activities and Festivals in the Past
Cultural and Belief Activities Places serving the belief and festival activities were gradually established in all villages and hamlets by local communities over a period of many hundreds of years, in the form of communal halls, temples and shrines, of which communal halls made up more than 90%.
The inventory list shows the dense distribution and establishment of worshipping places related to the worship of Hùng Kings in Phú Thọ Province.
In 46 villages and hamlets having worshipping sites under the direct name of the Hùng Kings there are 43 communal halls, 6 temples and 2 Buddhist temples.
In 76 villages/hamlets having worshipping sites under the names of Cao S?n Minh V??ng, ??t Ng?t Cao S?n, ?t S?n Thánh V??ng or Vi?n S?n Thánh V??ng there are 99 communal halls, 15 temples, 18 shrines, and 7 Buddhist temples.
According to the oral histories obtained from elderly people, in most villages/hamlets, before 1945, the worshipping sites dedicated to the Hùng Kings  in  particular  and  other  figures  in  Phú  Thọ  Province  in general were established  during one  or the  other of two  historical periods.
Before  the  10th century, most of the worshipping sites (communal halls, temples, and shrines) were made of bamboo and with thatched roofs, while some were made in the form of a house on pillars to avoid predators and flooding.
Since the Lý Dynasty, and especially under the Lê Dynasty (the 15th century), with the permission of local authorities and the court, people in Phú Thọ Province (as in many other places) mobilized the community to build big (both in terms of architectural structure and interior) worshipping sites in villages. People also organized large-scale sacred and solemn festivals.
Besides paying attention to the sites through granting conferments and orders, feudal  governments  also gave permission for villages to restore worshipping sites in order to serve the belief activities, considering this a tool of the ruling apparatus  at  different levels.
For the period after 1945, due to the limited knowledge of local authorities, and because of the weather and natural conditions, most worshipping  sites (90%) in Phú Thọ Province were destroyed or ran to ruin.
The most serious destruction occurred in 1956–57, 1961 and 1975.
Only since the 1990s have many of these worshipping sites been restored to serve the needs of  local cultural and belief activities.
Due to economic conditions, most of the restored worshipping sites are smaller in scale and simpler in architecture than their originals.
However, about 20% of the sites in these villages/hamlets have been completely destroyed, for various objective and subjective reasons.
Only since the time of ??i M?i (Renovation) in Vietnam have rural communities had opportunities to improve their economy and enrich their culture by restoring traditional cultural practices.
Having examined the real situation of the worshipping sites and taken into account community opinions, we see that most villages associated with the worship of the Hùng Kings in particular and  cultural and belief activities in general now need higher-level policy and economic support to restore or upgrade the worshipping sites in order to meet the short and long-term needs of the communities.
Worshipping Altars
In practice, it can be seen that of 181 communal halls and 15 Buddhist temples (of which 43 communal halls and 8 Buddhist temples are dedicated to the Hùng Kings) the focus of the altar arrangement is the worshipping tablet and the incense bowls.
At some worshipping sites, there is also an additional altar for all gods.
In general, the worshipping altars of the Hùng Kings are made in the form of ancestral altars like those which stand in the houses of most Vietnamese families.
Taking Ngh?a L?nh Mountain as the center of Hùng Kings worship, the farther worshipping sites are from this center, the simpler their arrangements; they are not as complicated as the worshipping sites built by feudal regimes at the end of the Post-Lê Dynasty or during the Nguy?n  Dynasty.
Offerings
Offerings prepared for the rituals (rituals of opening the communal halls/temple gates, processions, rituals of closing the communal halls/temple gates) in most localities are quite similar to one another. They include xôi (cooked sticky rice), o?n (cake from cooked sticky rice), fruits, flowers, wine, votive papers, salt, boiled chickens (ideally large, handsome roosters), raw pork (ideally from a black pig), ch?ng cake and dày cake (offered by people of Lâm Thao District and Vi?t Trì City).
n addition, some villages (?ào Xá village in Thanh Thọy District, B?n ?á village in C?m Khê District) include carp in their offerings.
In Tr?o and Vi villages (Lâm Thao District) and Hùng Lô village (Vi?t Trì City), people give whole pigs (ideally black pigs), usually already killed and cleaned, along with some of their bristles and blood, as offerings.
Some villages/hamlets of H? Hòa, ?oan Hùng, and Yên L?p districts require that among the offerings there should be meat from a black buffalo.
It is stipulated in village conventions that all participants in the preparation of offerings – for example, in the selection of roosters, pigs, leaves for the cakes, etc. should be carefully chosen. All the steps in making the cakes, killing the roosters or the pigs, etc. should also be taken very carefully.
For offerings made from meat (black pigs, roosters, buffalos, etc.), strict rules apply to all steps. For example, families chosen to raise the pigs should be happy, well-off, respected by other villagers and not in mourning; the pigs should be kept in open, clean pigsties; containers for their food should be clean and new (the families should buy new bowls and make new pigsties); their food should be clean and  delicious.
In some villages, two or three families are chosen to raise the  animals. When the day of the festival draws near, the entire village will select the best of several animals for the offerings.
When the pigs are killed, the blood should be red; if the blood is not bright red, it is considered bad luck.
When the rooster is killed and cleaned, its skin should not be torn. The rooster must not be put into boiling water, but hung on a stick above the pot, and people must pour boiling water over it until it is cooked.
In regard to fruits, in the past, villagers chose those without pips, and they could pick them only in the land where they had settled down and lived. They were not allowed to take fruits from other places.
Villagers believe that if these unwritten rules were violated, people would have bad luck, their livestock would fall sick, their crops would fail, etc.
In addition to offerings common to all villages/hamlets worshipping  the Hùng Kings, unique features of offerings prepared by certain villages may also be observed.
For example, in the offerings prepared by C? Tích village (Hy C??ng commune, Vi?t Trì City), three branches of young rice are laid on the offering tray together with cooked sticky rice and boiled rooster, and a wish for good weather and good crops is made.
In the rituals of Vi and Tr?o villages of Hùng S?n Town, Lâm Thao District, among the usual offerings there must be a votive black elephant and two horses (one pink and the other white). These animals are made of bamboo, covered with paper and life-size.
A small bamboo stick is tied to a side of each of these animals to serve as a pot where incense sticks can be kept until the last day of the festival when they are burned.
It is believed that these animals serve as means of transport for the Hùng Kings and the gods so that they can go to people facing difficulties such as strong winds, flood, disease, etc.
(See also Bùi Quang Thanh, “Offerings to Hùng Kings”. Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences, 6 (146) – 2011).
Selection of the Ritual Heads
In the past, the ritual head for each festival was also selected very carefully.
In feudal times (before 1945), ritual heads were selected by local authorities.
Later, this position usually came to be determined by village elders and representatives of village clans.
A person selected to be a ritual head should meet the following criteria: male, over 50 years old, with sound knowledge of the ritual procedures, trusted and respected by his community, and not in the mourning period.
When a person has been selected to be the ritual head, he should observe certain unwritten rules such as avoiding participation in  funerals, avoiding hard work and avoiding sexual intercourse to keep his body clean.
He must practice the ritual gestures regularly so that when the  time comes he can perform them gracefully and in conformity with the ritual group. If he makes a mistake, he will be punished by his village.
The ritual head from the year before is responsible for instructing him during his practice period.
In addition, the person selected to be the ritual head should be able to afford the organization of the festival, from inviting different troupes (chèo plays, ca trù singing, and xoan singing, etc.) to inviting his relatives to the festival, from the day of opening to the day of closing.
For the ritual group (??i t?) the criteria are less strict. Ritual group members must be middle-aged, respected by the community and not in the mourning period.
The ritual head manages the operation of the ritual group. People who know the ritual procedures well (usually from the ritual group of the year before) also help coach the ritual group for a time.
The Traditional Festivals
According to the oral histories of elders in all 196  villages/hamlets, before 1945 villages held the festivals each year on differing scales, depending on economic and social conditions and specific village customs.
In the past, two types of festivals took place every year:
The inter-canton festival (the festival jointly organized by several villages in a canton or jointly organized by villages in a customary friendship relationship, worshipping the same communal god);
The festival held in each village/hamlet at a different time (in this case, the people of village divisions (giáp) played a vital role).
Most of the festivals took place in the first lunar month or in the eighth and ninth lunar months.
The organizer of the festivals: As stipulated by the feudal authorities, before 1945 the Committee of Mandarins at canton level directly organized and managed festivals in which the main worshipped figures had been recognized and given conferment by the court.
In regard to village festivals, various giáp in the villages cooperated in organizing the festivals, with each giáp taking responsibility for specific tasks assigned by the Committee of Village Elders.
Funds for festival organization came from two sources: proceeds from fields given to the temple (by local authority or by the court), and donations by men of different giáp participating in the festivals.
Festival procedure: Most focus-group interviews came to the conclusion that festival procedure in individual villages in particular and throughout Phú Thọ Province in general was very complicated and diverse.
Currently there are no written texts (epitaphs, legends, village customary laws, etc.) in any villages/hamlets stipulating festival procedure.
Today festivals are organized according to procedures passed down from earlier generations.
However, certain procedural elements are common throughout the province.
In  most cases, the procession goes from the shrine to the communal hall or temple; or goes from the communal hall or temple around the village and returns to the starting point.
The order of the procession groups is also consistent from village to village: The group of the dancing dragon comes first, then the group carrying the gods’ flags, then the palanquin, eight musical instruments, two rows of eighttreasures and weapons, the incense palanquin, the chair and tablet palanquin, the ritual group, and finally the villagers.
Belief activities and folk games
In almost all the sacred spaces of Hùng Kings worship, local communities organize various cultural activities in which unique symbols representing specific characteristics of habitation, aesthetic style, and perceptions of nature and society are displayed.
These activities include:Belief activities associated with fertility rites, in which symbols of linga and yoni are worshipped and acts of sexual intercourse are mimicked in a game named tùng rí; Belief activities associated with wet-rice cultivation, in which water from the middle of a river is brought to the temple to serve as a worship object, and young rice plants are also placed on the altar; Belief activities in which the career and merits of the worshipped person are enacted: the gestures of the King when he taught people how to cultivate rice and hunt; the gestures of the Princess when she taught people how to raise silkworms and weave fabric.
Belief activities associated with the explanation of certain phenomena in nature and society: why people howl to call/find each other at night when lost in the forest; how the King taught people to make blood pudding when killing pigs.
Belief activities associated with unique inventions from the earliest days of the country’s establishment: how the King taught people how to broil meat after a hunt, perform martial arts, use the bow and arrow, and establish villages close to one another so that they could help and protect one another.
In most regions, especially in isolated villages, people perform similar prayer rituals, such as praying for wealth, for favorable weather, for peace, for a son, etc. in their worship of the Hùng Kings.
In addition to rituals and belief activities performed in the sacred space of the worship of Hùng Kings and other related characters, folk games associated with national memories and the community’s perceptions of everyday life's realities and aesthetic ideals are played by participants of various ages.
Some of these folk games are popular and common to all villages (such as blind-man’s-buff, tug of war, flag catching, swimming competition, and catching ducks in pond or river), and some are unique and specific to certain villages in Phú Thọ Province (such as pig encirclement, trò trám, a fertility game, c??p ph?t, a game of competing to catch a ball, tùng rí, etc.).
Belief Practice and Festivals in Contemporary Society
From the time of the August Revolution of 1945 until the end of the 20th century, for different reasons and because of different historical circumstances, most of the places serving belief practices such as temples, communal halls and shrines were destroyed or badly damaged, and folk festivals were not organized.
In most villages, people quietly prepared offerings and burnt incense to worship the Hùng Kings in particular and other related characters in general at home or in their family worshipping halls.
Thus, serious damage was done to these communities' tangible and intangible culture.
A great number of valuable cultural heritages have been lost, ruined or forgotten.
Gaps in the passing on of traditional culture between generations have had negative impacts on Hùng Kings worshipping communities' social and cultural life.
From the late 1980s on, particularly from 1995 until today, in the many villages in 12 districts worshipping the Hùng Kings in Phú Thọ Province, 50% of sites have been restored (after 1990), 10% have been repaired, 20% are in danger of becoming ruins, and 20% have already become ruins.
Before 1945, most villages worshipping the Hùng Kings regularly organized traditional festivals at different levels.
After nearly half a century  of interruption, from the late 1980s on, these traditional festivals have been restored. The belief and its associated cultural organizations have  been permitted to operate again.
In villages, the elderly (50 years and older) have played an important role in restoring and directly participating in festivals.
Funds for festival organization are mainly donated by local people.
Differences between Today's Festivals and Festivals in the Past
The duration of festivals today is much shorter than in the past (now they mainly take place over one or two days).
The processes of task assignment, budget management and organization of the festival are now discussed openly, and local people can share their opinions on all relevant matters.
All people of villages/hamlets where there are festivals have equal opportunity to participate in the annual or main festival (in accordance with regulations prescribed by festival management boards or local authorities), from contributing human resources to receiving material and moral benefits from the festival.
The festival is organized by the site management board which manages communal halls/ temples under the direct control of the local authority.
Funds for festival organization are partly given by the local authority if possible. However, in most cases, they are donated by the community. Common temple land from which benefits may be saved for festival organization as they were under feudal society no longer exists.
Because of issues of public security and changes in belief and other cultural practices, festivals now are not as boisterous as in the past. Ritual forms and offerings have also been simplified and the meanings of the worship objects have also been lost to some extent.
The process of preparation of offerings has been made simpler; complicated details relating to selection and arrangement of offerings as practiced in the past are now foregone.
Certain parts of the ritual ceremony which are too complicated or long have been removed or shortened.
Belief activities with mysterious meanings and amulets are not practiced anymore.
Further, certain cultural activities with fertility-related meanings have not been restored.
All members of local communities participate in “luck food” feasts, and all are equal in festival activities.
During the processes of preparation and organization of the festival, the community and the local authority coordinate closely with each other to ensure security and legal issues are dealt with following guidelines from the local authority.
Main Features of the Worship of Hùng Kings in Phú Thọ
Most Hùng Kings worshipping villages perform rituals associated with different annual festivals: Lunar New Year, First Full Moon, the festival of ploughing, the festival of harvest, etc.
Perhaps the most remarkable of these is the ritual praying for favorable weather, and good luck in business, life and health.
Offerings are very important. They are carefully selected and include at least three things – a rooster, a black pig and fruits.
To a certain extent, ancient elements associated with the worship of the Hùng Kings remain, expressing themselves in festival performances and folk games associated with ancient legends.
The festival is diverse in form and sacred in content and belief practice, displaying people’s profound awareness of their origins and their history of establishing and protecting the country.
Roles played in the festival are strictly controlled, requiring actors to be strong both in body and in mind.
The System of Cultural Heritage Sites associated with Hùng Kings Worship:
Tangible cultural heritage in villages: The inventory shows that most worshipping sites which are a hundred years old or older have been destroyed. The few which remain are in very bad condition.
Most of the common land which in the past belonged to the worshipping sites has been encroached upon (for example in villages of Đoan Hùng, Hạ Hòa and Yên Lập districts).
The surrounding facilities have also been destroyed, changed or used for other purposes, etc.
Many heritage sites have not received proper attention from cultural management boards.
Some sites have been encroached upon or used for non- belief purposes.
According to the statistics of the local authority, at present, in 46 villages/hamlets directly practicing the worship of Hùng Kings, 80% of the ponds associated with this belief have been either filled up or narrowed to serve different purposes.
any ponds, shrines and temples associated with heritage sites have disappeared: e.g. he place believed to be the drill ground during the time of the Hùng Kings in Tiên Kiên commune (Lâm Thao), Đạng communal hall in Xuân Viên commune (Yên Lập), Đanh communal hall in Chính Công commnune, Tân Tiến communal hall in Vĩnh Chân commune (Hạ Hòa). Some sites which in the past were spacious worshipping sites have been destroyed, and currently there are no fund for their restoration (e.g.Cả communal hall in Hùng Sơn town, Lâm Thao district; the cluster of sites in Đanh hamlet, Chính Công commune, Hạ Hòa).
Of the sites that have been restored in the last decade by local communities, none can be compared with its original in terms of scale and architecture.
In most of these new sites, the interior of the worshipping space is still simple and does not meet traditional requirements of worship.
The system of intangible cultural heritage in villages/hamlets: So far, most of the villages/hamlets in Phú Thọ Province which have sites associated with Hùng Kings worship do not keep documents of legends, festival information, folk games or activities related to this belief.
In some villages, elderly people try to keep records and translate the legends  and parallel sentences which have  been recorded at local heritage sites. However, this source of information has yet to be properly drawn on.
At some sites, there are collections of books in Sino-Vietnamese which have not yet been translated into modern Vietnamese, so that a great deal of information about traditional culture is still unknown and inaccessible to younger generations of local people.
Passing on Heritage between Generations: Those with the best knowledge of the procedures and contents of festivals are the elderly people who have directly participated in past festivals and performances.
The number of these people is small; however, some of them are now members of festival management boards and heritage site management boards in villages/hamlets.
The largest group of people participating in the rituals is made up of middle-aged men, aged 50 and older.
For certain festival activities, the largest group is made up of young people, aged from 15 to 25.
In the inventory questionnaires, 100% of respondents confirmed that younger generations – children of families living in the villages – are enthusiastic and eager to participate in certain festival activities, but are not eager to carry out ritual practices.
Interviews with children participating in the festival “Procession of the Kings to the village for Tết” (Hùng Sơn town) and “Meeting the Kings for the spring in villages” (Tiên Kiên commune) at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011, indicated that all were proud to have been selected and eager to participate in the festivals without being paid, given that they are allowed to by their families and schools.
However, because of modern social circumstances and time restrictions, not all young people actively look  for information about their nation’s origins or the aspects of their culture preserved and performed in local festivals.
Most of the legends, copies of the Kings’ family tree, epitaphs and other sources of information in Sino-Vietnamese which are kept in villages have not yet been translated or disseminated, nor have most of the parallel sentences and words inscribed on horizontal lacquered boards in communal halls, temples and Buddhist temples, or the many books in Sino-Vietnamese.
Issues Relating to the Preservation and Promotion of Heritage Values
The Situation and Positive Impact of the Heritage
Most of the belief and cultural activities associated with the worship of Hùng Kings (under different names) in 12 districts/town/cities of Phú Thọ Province have	already	received attention from	local communities, and worshipping sites and festivals have been restored.
However, economic difficulties together with other objective and subjective circumstances have meant that the number of restored sites is still small.
Examples can be given in poor districts such as Hạ Hòa, Thanh Ba, Yên Lập, and Thanh Sơn.
Also, because the belief practice was prohibited and therefore did not receive any attention from local authorities or local people for half a century, many sites have been encroached upon to differing degrees.
Many of the objects used at rituals or for interior decoration are broken.
Meanwhile, communities need  ritual practice.
In most localities, costs for the restoration of worshipping sites have been covered by communities.
Examples can be given in Cẩm Khê and Phù Ninh districts and Việt Trì City.
Among villagers today, middle-aged people show the highest level of awareness of the necessity of heritage preservation, as evidenced by their contributions to preservation projects.
If in the second half of the 20th century elderly people were the largest group practicing Hùng Kings  worship,  then since the 1990s more and more young people have been participating in worshipping activities, both male and female.
Particularly in localities with many traditional festivals such as Cẩm Khê, Lâm Thao, Thanh Thuỷ, and Phù Ninh districts and Việt Trì City, people of widely different groups and backgrounds participate in festivals.
In the last ten years, several localities have restored festival activities worshipping the Hùng Kings (Đào Xá commune in Thanh Thuỷ district, Hùng Lô commune in Việt Trì City, Khổng Tước commune in Cẩm Khê district, Vi and Trẹo villages in Hùng Sơn town and villages in Tiên Kiên commune, Lâm Thao district, etc.), thus helping younger generations understand and learn more about traditional values, their nation’s history, and preservation of traditional values.
The survey of villages where festivals worshipping Hùng Kings are held in particular and village festivals in general shows that local authorities and cultural  management  boards  at  different  levels  (but  especially  at commune level) have directly participated in and taken responsibility for organizing, managing and monitoring all steps of the festivals, and that in this respect local people are satisfied with local authorities at commune and village level.
This is also evidence of the consensus which has created sustainable conditions for the preservation of the festivals, bringing a positive influence upon the exploitation of the festivals’ values and meanings.
As a first step, the local authority has co-operated with the community in accordance with the principles of socialization in management in order to preserve and exploit the heritage site’s values, and restore the heritage sites as required in each specific case, meeting the community’s needs in belief  practice.
90% of survey respondents agreed with the work done by the local authority during restoration and preservation of festivals associated with the worship of Hùng Kings.
Possible Risks for the Heritage Sites:
95% of survey discussion participants saw weaknesses and limitations in various aspects of the heritage preservation: namely, in collection of related information, and in historical recording of the worship and procedures of local traditional festivals. The number of people who know Sino-Vietnamese has decreased significantly; in some localities today, no one knows this language.
Most of the knowledge of festival procedures, content, activities and performance (palanquin procession, folk games, etc.) has only been passed on orally.
Some elderly people have been trying to record this kind of information. Mainly, however, they do it spontaneously and subjectively. The information recorded has not been discussed carefully and has not been disseminated widely in the community.
This has led to the gradual loss of this source of intangible cultural heritage which was invented and practiced in the past and to loss of the unique local identity associated with it.
100% of discussion participants regarded the local authority’s weakness at various levels in managing the processes of information collection, recording and disseminating relevant information to members of the community as one of the causes of the loss of heritage site values.
90% of discussion participants believed that the local authority was not active enough or creative enough in widening its network and mobilizing resources in society for the preservation and exploitation of cultural heritage in the locality.
100% of discussion participants suggested that the local authority should improve its capacity in management so that the Law on Cultural Heritage could be implemented in practice and made to meet the needs of cultural heritage preservation in each village/hamlet.
As stated by some representatives of village heritage management boards, one of the reasons that heritage sites had been neglected and their ecological- human environment negatively affected was that the people tasked with taking care of the sites (temple guards, ritual heads, members of the heritage management boards, etc.) were not paid for their service.
Cultural management at various levels focuses largely on drawing up and disseminating  administrative guidelines and organizing activities to disseminate government policies. Cultural management workers are not proactive in making long-term plans for the preservation and exploitation of cultural heritage values in the localities.
Most of the cultural management staff working for the Department of Culture and Information at district level or commune/ward level are young people with limited knowledge of local traditional culture.
Therefore, their management is not effective and cannot meet the community’s needs in preservation and exploitation of cultural heritage.
In practice, coordination between schools and the community in the preservation of cultural heritage in villages is weak.
The relevant propaganda does not seem to be very effective.
In the Year 6 Textbook on Linguistics and Culture, the section introducing legends and traditional festivals associated with the period of Hùng Kings and the nation’s origin is quite short.
In some places, the local authority and the community disagree on the values of their cultural heritage.
For example, in Xuân Viên commune, Yên Lập district, the local authority currently is withholding approval of the restoration of worship places which had existed in the past but were destroyed in the 1970s, arguing that it does so to fight superstition.
The community is willing to contribute money to restore these heritage sites which in the past were part of the grand procession in the commune’s traditional festival. However, the local authority has not given its approval for the restoration, and so the people of Xuân Viên commune must practice their belief in the neighboring commune.
Property violation and encroachment occurs at many sites of Hùng Kings worship, due to either bad land use management or bad cultural management, illegally or with the permission of the local authority.
in addition, the local authority in some places also allows people to destroy heritage sites to use the land for other purposes.
Most discussion participants suggested that the authorities at various levels should pay more attention to groups of successful local businessmen who wish to fund the restoration of their local cultural heritage.

Bach Hac or White Crane is a name that has long been used.
It is written in Linh Nam Chich Quai (a Collection of Strange Stories in Linh Nam) that: "there was in the ancient Phong Chau a big wide shade tree called Chien Dan on which white cranes built their nests, thus this area is named Bach Hac or White Crane": The region of Bach Hac Confluence is where three big rivers namely Thao, Da and Lo meet each other.
Located in a convenient position, Bach Hac was a great place of residence for the ancient Vietnamese people, since it had mountains, hills and plains. When the area was flooded,they moved to hills and mountains to make a living there and if the weather was good, they spead to the plains to cultivate rice.
Moreover, this area was chosen by Hung Kings for the establishment and construction of Van Lang State.
On this area still exist various legends of the time when Hung Kings founded Van Lang state such as the story of Heaven God (whose heel is still seen engraved on a stone on the edge of Bach Hac river) giving names to 100 children of Lac Long Quan, the legends of the fight between Son Tinh and Thuy Tinh, and of two brothers named Tho Lenh and Thach Khanh.
Bach Hac is also a place of various historical and cultural relics such as Tam Giang Pagoda, Bach Hac Communal House, Lang Dai Temple, Ha Than Shrine. Coming to Bach Hac, visitors can have a chance to enjoy a number of important festivals and events such as Bach Hac Regetta Festival, Glutinuous Rice Dumpling Contest, Wrestling Competition, etc. The name of each commune and village in Bach Hac is associated with one legend of Hung Kings time.
The land of Bach Hac Confluence has long been well-known for its charming waterways and liveliness. In the afternoon, the flaming sun sets down to Ba Vi Range amid the happy folksongs sung by fishermen who are catching fish in the river.
All these make Bach Hac a land of picturesque landscapes with its unique and distinct tangible and intangible cultural heritages an appealing point of arrival for visitors who come here to be fully satisfied.

Cottages with palm-leaf roof, conical peaked hats and raincoats made from the leaves of palm trees have long protected generations of Vietnamese people from hard weather conditions.
At present, Phu Tho provides major source of this material for the production of handicrafts and, more importantly is an ideal destination for those who come here on eco-tours, for relaxation and entertainment.

The province each year exports 10,000 tones of dried tender tea.
Those who have been to Phu Tho’s midland areas of Doan Hung, Thanh Ba, Ha Hoa, Cam Khe, Phu Ninh, etc. would never forget their green tea hills which look like layers of glutinous rice trays, featuring magnificent natural landscape.
Midland girls are very skillful in picking tender tea leaves smiling happily and singing folksongs, which reflects the tranquil life of a rural area.
It would be great to take sips of strong green tea which is a little bit bitter at first, but then leave a long lasting sweet after taste. It is difficult to tell the feeling of drinking the tea from the teapot of weather-beaten farmers in the tea area who will tell us many stories about the tea tree and legends of the national building era. It would also be very wonderful to enjoy a bowl of green tea by the elderly here avoiding the extreme heat of summer days.

Being situated in Lang Ca, Tho Son commune, Viet Tri city, Phu Tho province, and had been discovered in 1959, the relics has been nationally recognized.
Archeological findings have revealed that this used to be the habitat, and then the burial site of old Viet people in Hung Kings' time.
The relics dated from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD.

Go De archaeological relics containing of diverse tools, conveying the development of ancient Viet indigenous civilizations of Van Lang State.
Boasting a long history, Phu Tho is renowned as the cradle of Vietnam civilization; thus, Phu Tho people have been restoring and developing traditions and typical features of Vietnamese people.
The people here are famous for their creativeness, their perseverance in struggling, their kind-heartedness and artistic souls.
Craft villages of Phu Tho province are illuminating evidence for the observation.
Phu Tho's small industrial and handicrafts production have taken pride in their long history of development.
Perhaps, the traditional handicrafts are not highly efficient but these indigenous products create a considerably typical image for Phu Tho people.
Along the national highway numbered 32 by Hong riven tourists would arrive at Phu Lac, a mountainous village of Cam Khe district, Phu Tho provice.
It is a great chance to sink in a unique world of traditional bamboo charcoal handicrafts, ranging from sophisticated glasses, natural vases, and lovely coffee spoons to delicate blinds, and fragrant orchid baskets.
Bamboo charcoal with artistic beauty has become invaluable for filtering water and deodorizing, which are of great benefits for human health and the environment.
Bamboo charcoal products are of popularity among consumers in developed countries including Japan, South Korea, and China as they are capable of absorbing the harmful substance in the air and in water.
Bamboo charcoal is made from burning bamboo trees, with great care and lots of skills because the ending products may be burnt over into ash or otherwise into coal during a shorter period than required.
Temperature needs to be adjusted to harden and widen the surface of charcoal like iron.
However hard the job sounds, charcoal production of Phu Lac (Cam Khe) enjoys its prestige on the market share as a results of its superior quality.
Although it is not as hectic as other traditional craft villages in Hong River delta region.
Do Xuyen has become a traditional craft village with unique products and its distinctive quietness.
The origin of the village’s bamboo weaving occupation is not acknowledged, though, one cannot deny that it has helped Do Xuyen people survive from a variety of flooding seasons and become an important part-time job for villagers.
The villages products are very simple and hardly needs any investment but skillful hands. The low-profit production has to some certain extent presented the prestige villagers' culture and life in the competitiveness of market mechanism.
The major manufactured goods of Do Xuyen village is bamboo fiberboard for construction with various designs, meeting customers' needs: ceiling fiberboard, measuring 1 meter x 3 meters, or 1 meter x 4 meters, or bamboo containers of varied sizes and reasonable prices.
Do Xuyen can be named as a Bamboo mat village because its bamboo products are widely sold and have created financial resources for villagers.
Furthermore, another typical product is Mam Chap still in existence in spite of the market mechanism.
Nowadays, the occupation of chap bamboo production has witnessed great development up to now, thanks to the investment by Hon Ngoc Vien Dong Ltd., Company the products of Do Xuyen village including bamboo dishes, bowls, and chopsticks have been exported to foreign markets, which is of an immense support for Do Xuyen people to restore the traditional occupation and improve their life.
Being famous nationwide as the home of palm trees, Phu Tho has inevitably develops the conical hat occupation, which is of small-scale, though.
Unlike conical hats of Chuong village in Ha Tay province, Phu Tho conical hats’ most recognizable feature is their simplicity harmonious lines, durableness and reasonable price.
A wide range of villages in Phu Tho are involved in hat production occupation; among them, there arise some prominent ones including Son Nga, Sai Nga, Thanh Nga, Dong Phu and Phu Khe.
The oldest craft village is Son Nga; however; its production of cone hats has now diminished as a result of their low cost-effectiveness.
Sai Nga is comparatively the biggest conical hat producers in the region in recent decades. The village has become a large workshop bustling all day with manufacturing processes of leaf cutting, ironing, designing and hat sewing.
A good hat is defined as the one with beautiful and even sewing lines and smooth surface.
Interestingly the most beautiful one has a verse of romantic poem, or a picture placed in between two layers of thin leaves.
Have you ever stopped in a small shop in roadside to sip a cup of tea on a freezing winter day and noticed the use of a handicraft product of Viet Nam countryside to keep warm for the cup of tea?
It is U Am - traditional teapot warm keeper, which may be considered as the product only for nostalgic people. In modern life, there are many electrical appliances but the teapot warm keeper have been conventionally used in many Vietnamese families and become a favorite souvenir for foreign tourists.
Son Vy a small village of Lam Thao district, Phu Tho province is native land of the unique product.
The occupation of producing teapot warm keepers has expanded in Son Vy Village for more than 100 years, despite of ups and downs in social development.
Villagers have skillfully and artistically created the teapot warm keeper with an exceptional design.
Each teapot warm keeper has turned out to be a familiar utensil of each family throughout the year.
Son Vy’teapot warm keeper was awarded silver medal in the National Handicrafts And Fine Arts Products Fair.
If more efforts are invested in improving its decoration and design, the cost effectiveness of Son Vy teapot warm keepers will be considerably increased, which are a considerable stimulation for the development of traditional craft village.
Doan Ket Hamlet of Hung Lo commune, Phu Ninh district has been well-known for processing vermicelli, rice noodle and rice sheets for hundreds of years.
The hamlet's products have established their brand name and won customers’ trust with their high quality.
For years, the craft village has been in humble and tenacious existence, surprising visitors with the bustling working environment of grinding workshops and many generations of Hung Lo people have grown up with the occupation.
Production of glass noodle and rice noodle hardly requires huge investment so any family can run the business.
Machinery has now replaced the manual manufacturing process, which was in use for decades. A household can now produce 200-300 kilograms per day, helping Hung Lo commune to supply dozens of tons of dried foods such as vermicelli, noodle and rice paper and to market on a daily basis.
Minh Duc Carpentry Village is located in Thanh Uyen commune of Tam Nong district, Phu Tho provice.
The foremost products of the village are commonly-known furniture of beds, cupboards, wardrobes.
Despite of their unpretentious appearance and design, the products have enjoyed popularity because of high quality which satisfy customers’ needs. However; that does not necessarily mean Minh Duc carpentry is without typical splendor.
The origins of carpentry occupation in the village are not known, though; it has become the major of all villagers, earning an annual income of tens of billions of VNDs.
Minh Duc wooden products have widespread to every corner of the nation from rural to urban areas, though, not every user knows its origin.
Placing the trade mark on each product has been all villagers’ desire.
One interesting way to reach a new land and new culture is to enjoy foods there.
The idea is always right because gastronomy is cultural characteristics of each region.
Phu Tho, the ancestor’s land, will serve friends and guests from every corner of country with its special-but- popular dishes.
Lang: habitat living is wide, deep and strong current rivers.
The fishes live in the bed of the river and their food is small animals.
They only appear on the water surface when they are grown-up so fishermen can catch big fish of few kilos to dozens of kilos.
Lang fish is the best tasty catfish.
In the three rivers junction of Viet Tri, there is Anh Vu fish which is considered the rarest river fish.
Anh Vu fish also live in river bed eating mosses on stones. They shelter in caves during the summer time and go out in autumn and winter seasons.
So Anh Vu fish can be caught only in chilled and misty days.
In the feudal period, Anh Vu fish were dedicated to kings only.
Chay fish live in a section of Thao River of Thanh Ba district.
The fish has two delicious spawns.
Connoisseurs don’t hesitate to choose Chay fish for their meals.
In recent years, in Viet Tri city there have been some restaurants serving these fishes.
The most well-known and well- established one is Quan Ca Bo Song (Riverside Fish Restaurant) and following by Quan Ca Bach Hac (Bach Hac Fish Restaurant) and some others.
In recent years, Banh Tai (Tai Cake), a special snack of Phu Tho town ship has regained its reputation. Tai Cake is used in wedding and parties as substituting rice.
Tai Cake has been presented and become a nosh of people of Hanoi and many regions nationwide.
The cake cannot last longer than a day, therefore it requires great care.
Phu Tho Tai Cake has been made by Phu Tho village for long time and called Hon Cake.
The cake is shaped like an ear made from rice powder filled with pork. In fact, the recipe and tools are not too complicated but not everyone can succeed.
Like in the old tome, choosing what rice for making cake is a decisive factor to the taste of the cake. Rice must be soft and glutinous.
After being rinsed, rice is soaked into cold water for a period ranging from two hours to half of a day.
Then rice is ground into powder and made into pieces, which requires the cake makers to use his, or her strength to ensure absolute mixture After that, the powder pieces will be ground in a mortar, and modeled with hand (without any mould).
Skillful people can ensure cakes of same shape, like a thin ear, with pork in the middle.
In the next stage, cake are steamed for 30-60 minutes.
During the process, it is recommended not to make the powder curdle.
Tai Cake is the most delicious on being served hot.
Eating Tai Cake we cannot us spoon or folk but just by hands or a piece of banana leaf. It is the best way you can enjoy the taste of cake completely. It is well blended among glutinous, sweet taste and good smell.
Also being cooked into the 7 dishes like other regions, but Viet Tri Dog Meat has its own taste thanks to professional cooking.
Choosing the meat ingredient plays an important part, omitting the use of commercial fed dogs; dogs raised by mountainous minority people are favorable. Preparing process and using spices are secrets handed over generation to generation within family.
After enjoying dishes, I just can describe as follows: the meat is soft, color is nice. Sausages and grilled meat have good smell and soft.
And dish of steamed dog legs has unfor-gettable taste and smell.
Last dish o stewed bones with green papaya is really a specialty of the midland region.
Viet Tri’ people take pride in their popular gastronomy. And I am sure that if you once visit Viet Tri you would be offered the delicious and special dishes.
Doan Ket Road is considered a center of Viet Tri Dog Meat with about 20 restaurants serving the dishes.
The restaurants have existed for many years but still in simple decoration. The restaurant owners here confirm that well-decorated compartments and well-designed tables are unsuitable for enjoying Viet Tri Dog Meat dishes.
Melientha suavis has been listed in Vietnam Red Book, and the most valuable vegetables among 300 edible ones in Xuan Son National Park.
Having favourable conditions of altitude, humidity and soil, Xuan Son National Park enjoys the biggest number of natural grown melientha suavis in Vietnam.
Melientha suavis is not only important in ecological diversity but also a delicious vegetable for human beings.
The top, leaves, flowers can be cooked in soup, while ripe fruits is edible.
The plants have economic values, medical usages, and also environment significance, because they can last hundreds of years, playing an essential role in reforestation procedure of the National Park.
Melientha suavis can be grown from seeds, or roots and introduced between and among reforested plants or spread between fruiting plants.
The plant is now scattered among other fruiting trees in Xuan Son National Park and neighboring villages.
It is known that the all three regions of Vietnam share a common feature, i.e. possessing delicious grapefruit breeds.
Phuc Trach Pomelo is a specialty of sunny and windy Central region, while Nam Roi Pomelo is grown in fertilize land of South region, and Doan Hung pomelo planted in Doan Hung district of Phu Tho province is quintessence of midland area.
Doan Hung Pomelo also called "Phu Doan Pomelo" is well known with its special characteristics of small size; juiciness, sweet and soft taste and thin skin.
Today Doan Hung district boasts more pomelo breeds such as Bang Luan grape-fruit characterized by big size and yellow skin, hybrid plumose with big size and sour taste; La Hoang pomelo; and Suu pomelo is a rare breed and the first option of connoisseurs.
Perhaps, what makes Doan Hung pomelo special is its extraordinary fragrance.
During Tet holiday the fragrance of Doan Hung grape-fruit displayed in ancestors' altar can inspire a cozy family atmosphere.
Moreover, the pomelo planting has been improving people living standard. Each fruit sent to every corner of the country represents the heart and soul of pomelo growers.
So Doan Hung Pomelo has a unique taste of simplicity but specialty.
Hong Hac (Hac Persimmon), a specialty of the ancestor land, was famous for being ranked in the first of five kinds of rare fruits dedicated to kings long ago.
Hong Hac is a pride of the ancestor land's people.
So far, many persimmon gardens in Viet Tri have life-size and hundred-year-old plants.
Unlike other persimmon, Hong Hac are of big size, squares shape, crispiness and sweet taste without seeds.
Newly-picked Hong Hac have first to be soaked in glazed terra-cotta jars with water taken from a stone well in Tien Cat Viet Tri city for three days to make them sweeter and crispier and more yellow.
Hong Hac is simple and natural as manner of the locals.
Cherishing a persimmon and peeling it with a sharp knife, one can feel the sweet fragrance, and elegant taste that seems to inspire the soul.
The freshness, crispiness and sweetness lasts for long time, leaving unforgettable pleasure.
Enjoying Hong Hac in the mid-Autumn party under the moonlight night is a wonderful and remarkable moment.
Among dozens of tea products, Phu Tho people have choosen a simple and natural drink to serve friends and guests. It is Fresh Green Tea.
Talking about the fresh and tonic drink, everyone may suppose it was simply processed.
What you only need to do is to choose some dozens of fresh tea leaves rinsed in water and dip into in to a jar with hot water, and serve after 20 or 30 minutes.
It is right but not enough for the simple but elegant drink.
Observing the way of enjoying fresh green tea of people here, we can under-stand the “tradition” of the gastronomy.
Choosing the tea plant for fresh green tea drink must be done with care.
To ensure the fine color and scent and sweet-harsh taste, you should choose tea plants growing in a hustle with others plants in forests.
The feet of trees are rough and as big as a house column, and leaves are sometimes too high to be picked.
If you like harsh taste, you should choose the trees growing in areas of sunlight. While, if you like sweet taste, the trees under shadow is the option.
The best tea leaves are yellowish, with stable stems.
Water making the fresh green tea is also selected proper resource.
There is something mysterious, each village has only one water source for making tea. It is called Gieng Que (homeland well).
The fresh green tea connoisseurs use terra-cotta kettles to cooking tealeaves and cork the spout to avoid overflowing quintessence.
Sipping fresh green tea while chatting with friends is to ease the thirst during hard-working days, to feel home when being homesick and make the sweet-and-harsh taste in our memory forever.

Danang Tourism Logo &amp; Slogan
The main creation idea is the stylization of 2 letters D and N, first letters of Da Nang.
The logo’s parts are created by sturdily rising lines and lively colors to represent the idea of the variety and young vitality of Danang.
To increase the visual efficiency, logo is embossed with split lines.
The embossment can be clearly perceived at a distance observation.
Clear-cut features in the creation confirm the idea of the strong development of Danang.
5 parts in logo represent for 5 mountains of Marble Mountains.
As a famous landscape, Marble Mountains deserves one of the most meaningful symbols for Danang tourism.
5 parts with 5 bright colors showcase the young, dynamic city.
Each color represents one feature of Danang tourism.
Green symbolizes for the purity and the natural diversity.
Yellow and orange show the tropical sunlight sparkling on waves, on sand.
Red and purple mean the beauty of enthusiasm and friendliness of Danang people.
And blue arouse the image of “one of the most luxurious beaches in the world”… The gracefulness of logo’s forming and color is based on the steady platform that is DANANG and slogan “Fantasticity!” to make the perfect whole.
Besides obvious meanings, the logo form arouses the image of sails fill with wind.
Not only do sails heading for the sea represent a picturesque coastal city, but they also symbolize the young vitality and the strong will of development.
That is about Danang in my perception: young, dynamic and blooming.
Overall, the combination of color parts makes a blossom that represents a charming Danang, an auspicious Danang.
This is also a blossom opening in hearts of tourists when they come to Danang.
Danang is neither a heritage destination like Hue, Quang Nam nor a vibrant, bustling tourist city like Nha Trang but with the sustainable development strategy, the city is building up values of the diversity, the friendliness, the association with heritages, the preservation and consolidation of tradition, the improvement of living standards…
I have read an article introducing that Danang people seem not know how to marketing for tourism. If you ask Danang people what special things Danang has, they may hesitate to give you answer but they can take care of your journey, let you experience and feel on your own. Therefore, good feelings about Danang naturally sprout in your heart.
What are my good feelings? Well, they are… Charming smiles of visitor supporting team, of tourism pedicab riders are very typical for the friendliness of Danang.
Modern, unique bridges reveal the dynamic development of Danang.
White sandy beaches full of sunshine and undiscorvered virgin forests paint the gorgeous natural picture.
Scattered traditional villages which await to be recovered recall the cultural beauty of Quang Da area … Each part, each color, each beauty felt by tourists when they visit Danang opens a petal of sympathetic flower that would be blooming in their heart once they completely feel Danang’s beauties.
Tourists have to utter a compliment “FantastiCity!” or “Fantastic City!”.
Slogan “FantastiCity!” is the combination of “Fantastic” and “City”.
Because having “C” in common, 2 words are joined together to become 1 strange and interesting word that sounds like a noun.
The slogan is easily understandable.
With an exclamation mark at the end, the slogan “FantastiCity!” is a compliment from satisfied and happy tourists.
Slogan “FantastiCity!” represents the philosophy of Danang tourism: The satisfaction and happiness of tourists for their discovery and experience in the fantastic city.

Pho (noodle soup)
Throughout the country, you can easily find yourselves a hot bowl of pho.
Yet if you are a food expert or you have been getting acquainted to the particular tastes of Hanoi pho, you will find that there is no such pho that can have the flavors of the one served in Hanoi.
The light sweet of the hot broth which floods the white rice noodle having particular flavors of Hanoi will bring you the most satisfying feeling.
rice vermicelli served with snails
Being one of the most famous dishes of Hanoi, bun oc can satisfy people at all ages.
The dish, however, is very simple, containing only rice vermicelli, several snails and the sour broth besides some herbs.

A Hanoi dish that makes people want to try immediately only by hearing its name. For a long time, bun dau mam tom has become a specialty that many people have to try whenever setting feet to the capital city.
A set of bun dau mam tom includes a dish of fresh rice vermicelli, fried tofu, shrimp paste mixed with lemon or kumquat juice, raw vegetables, and boiled pork. Some restaurants even add fried fish paste to the set. It will be a big mistake if visitors to Hanoi skip bun dau mam tom.

A popular street food of Hanoi which is favored by many people. It is not difficult for you to find a bistro or restaurant selling banh da cua at a reasonable cost.
It is a delicious dish with many positive points as it is easy to taste and it neither makes your stomach heavy nor causes you to get tired of eating the food.
The crab noodle soup is normally served with cha lua (Vietnam’s pork sausage), boiled water spinach, bean sprouts, mingled in the mouthwatering aroma of fried shallots and the greasy taste of roasted peanuts.
deep fried fermented pork, grilled fermented pork
Although being considered snack, nem chua is indeed the one-and-only specialty of Hanoi.
If the grilled one has an eye-catching yellow color along with a delicious greasy taste, the fried one has a pink color and brings eaters wonderful flavors created from a combination of pork meat and pigskin.
The two dishes can be found at many restaurants but it is recommended that you should come to the bistro at 36 Tam Thuong Street, Hang Gai Ward, Hoan Kiem District to taste the best fried fermented pork of Hanoi and visit the restaurant at 10 Au Trieu Street in Hoan Kiem District to have the most tasty grilled fermented pork of the capital city.

Appearing in the capital city for several years now, the mixed tofu sweet soup has quickly become a favorite snack to reduce the heat in hot days of young people in Hanoi.
Normally, a bowl of mixed tofu sweet soup includes lotus seed, red bean, jelly, and dried copra. All of those ingredients will then be flooded with the syrup which has the fragrance of jasmine and the greasy coconut milk.
Trang Tien ice cream
The ice cream which for years has “enchanted” so many food lovers.
Trang Tien ice cream is famous for its particular flavors and a quality that cannot be mistaken for any ice cream product of other brands. Speaking of Trang Tien ice cream, people would remember the greasy taste of mung bean, the aroma smell of green rice, the sweet taste of milk chocolate and the light sweet of coconut milk. What makes Trang Tien ice cream a satisfying snack is its cost, which is especially reasonable.

For International tourists who are interested in Responsible tours.
In May 2nd 2014, Vietravel organized a responsible tour to Cu Chi for a group of teachers and students coming from Australia.
The group also visited the old battlefield in Long Tan commune, Dat Do district, Ba Ria Vung Tau province.
Many foreign tourists have special concerns about Responsible tours as they could do something to contribute for the local residents.
Responsible tours give tourists new emotional experiences in their life.
The group of 25 Australian teachers and students came to Vietnam to learn about Vietnamese history and carried out numerous charity activities.
The group visited Thien Phuoc house, which is home of disabled children, at Hamlet 6, An Nhon Tay commune, Cu Chi Dist, Ho Chi Minh city.
They also met and helped blinded children and students from a school named Nhat Hong in HCM city center.
In the evening, the group had dinner at KOTO restaurant where street kids are given opportunities to be trained for cooking and serving in a restaurant, to get ready for their future.
Just within some days, the group have connected all three humanity destinations together and made their tour so meaningful.
In the 14-day-long journey, the Australian students also spent time at the Old battlefield at Long Tan commune, Ba Ria Vung Tau Province which used to be a garrisoned place of Australian army during the Vietnam war.
They visited Long Tan Monument, Long Phuoc underground to experience and see the pictures of the old war in underground commander station, emergency stations and battlefield.
Long Tan battlefield is one of the favorite destinations for Australian tourists.
Besides, the worldwide famous Cu Chi tunnels were also visited as they could give them clear ideas of how severe the war was and how brave and creative the Vietnamese guerillas were in the war.
The tour “Visiting the old battlefield” seems not only for veterans but also for pupils, students- a young generation who don’t know much about wars happening in the past. They come to learn about the history of Vietnam, and the most important thing is to love the peace gained from harsh fighting in wars.
It is the purpose why Vietravel have designed numerous responsible tours to many historical places in Vietnam, which are the milestones in the country’s history.

In the chilly cold weather of the 28 December 2012, the tourist group of Vietravel consisting of many expats has arrived at Ta Phin Junior School, Sapa District to bring aids to the children here.
This is the first departure in the program called “Spring for Compassion” by Vietravel.

In the recent snowfall, Ta Phin was one of the villages suffering badly. Poor children did not have good sweaters to go to school, many had to skip classes and stay home as outside was too cold.
Mr. Ha Tien Dung, Principal of Ta Phin Junior School said there had been some philanthropists who conducted activities at the school.
The visit of Vietravel group was much appreciated and the support was meaningful as it helped poor children to keep their schooling uninterrupted through the cold winter.
For many years, Vietravel always pay a close attention to charity work at poor villages in the mountain province of Lao Cai, specially the district of Sapa, Muong Khuong and Simacai.
Combining travel and charity is a solution to socialize charity and community sharing, where the travel company and its tourists join hands to give aids to people in need during a trip. This is one of the objectives that Vietravel is aiming at.
The company hoped there would be more tourists joining the program and more support reaching children and people in Lao Cai.

CELEBRATION NIGHT OF VIETRAVEL’S 18TH ANNIVERSARY (20 DEC 1995 – 20 DEC 2013)
On 20 December 2013, in the event of Vietravel’s 18th Anniversary, many activities have taken place in Vietravel offices nationwide.
In HCM City, hundreds of Vietravel staff have had a special night of gathering.
Following is a series of photo reporting this meaningful event.
Congratulations to Vietravel, 18 years of continuous effort by generations of management and workers.
Hundreds of staff and managers gathered at the event in family spirit.
Raising voice in the song "Vietravel We are one - We are the one, ready for any challenge to be the pioneer.

VIETRAVEL’S PRIDE: 18 YEAR JOURNEY TO SUCCESS
At the age of 18, Vietravel is filled with the energy of a growing youth who is living up to the mission of contributing for a better community, living up to the responsibility of self-improvement for the satisfaction of tourists.
The 18 year journey of Vietravel is a dream for any business, not only for how fast the company has grown or for the honorable national and international awards, but for the success in conquering the hearts of hundreds of thousands tourists for a sustainable development.
Vietravel and the mission of a pioneer.
Anyone would say a new road will be full of hardship, challenges and chances of failure. However, where there is a will there is a way. Set your heart and go all out for it, you will finally overcome the obstacles to arrive at the finish line.
Vietravel set its heart to be a pioneer and marched on its course with unsurpassed determination and steaming energy in its veins.
Starting with 10 million VND, Vietravel scored 55 billion of sales in 2000, 370 billion in 2005 and accessed the leading position of Vietnam’s tourism industry with 1,480 billion in 2010. Records were set to be hit: 2,000 billion of sales in 2011, 2,500 billion in 2012 and, the company is trying to hit 3,000 billion for 2013.
Numbers are only numbers, but growing 300,000 times bigger in 18 years is really something to admire.
The success came from smart strategy of market development in all domestic, outbound and inbound travel; the continuous expansion of the retail network facilitating the direct contact with tourists; a flexible product policy; and especially the uncompromising commitment to service quality and professionalism.
If the history were converted to a screenplay, the director could have to spend a lot of thoughts on how to depict the rugged journey of a pioneer who put on his own shoulders a great mission. The company is striving for professionalism, while continuously utilizing its competitive strengths to ensure inspiration and added values for its customers.
Generations of employees join the company one after another, but together they made Vietravel a big family with love and sharing.
No one ever complained about the hardship as they all understood that was where they should get better than what they were.
If it was a midnight arrival, the tourguide wouldn’t mind leaving home and rushing through late streets to pick up the tourists. He had to count on his family members who took care of the family when he was away. There were sales reps that burst out in tears when she received a compliment from her customers. There were evenings when one could have been at home for dinner, but many managers and employees still worked at their desk to get the job done.
That sacrifice has been rewarded when the company received honorable titles and recognitions from tourists, the media, the industry authorities and the government.
Have a look back. The last 18 years were a series of adversities, from the economy crisis in the region in 1997, the bird flu epidemic in the next years, and the worldwide crisis which swept away a great number of businesses. Somehow, Vietravel was able to withstand the profound recession thanks to its all out effort and the collective strength of the management and the staff.
The success was beyond expectation. Vietravel possesses priceless assets that any other company must covet: a strong team, a strong customer base and a strong business culture.
More than 1,000 employees are committed to the mission: responsibility towards the environment and the community. This army is marching to its target from little things that contribute to the mission and it has a strong support from the customers as the foothold for to realize its goals.
Vietravel - Customer oriented philosophy and the art of listening
Looking at things from the angle of its customers and listening to the demand, Vietravel was always trusted by the customers.
After 18 years of hard work, Vietravel has become not only the flagship of Vietnam tourism industry but also taken a part in promoting the image of Vietnam tourism to a new height with new goals and mission.
One after another, new offices of Vietravel has been springing up inside and outside Vietnam.
Vietravel was able to establish its brandname even in Cambodia, Thailand, USA. By 2013, Vietravel has expanded the network to as many as 47 offices nationwide from Lao Cai to Ca Mau.
The challenges in a larger playground have been defined, on the other hand, a thousand staff of Vietravel are firm with their course, striving to become Vietnam’s first multi-national travel company in 2015 and one of top ten leading tour operators in Asia by 2020.
To reinforce its commitment, in 2011 Vietravel made a breakthrough achievement and became one of the top 16 leading tour operators in Asia, winner of TTG Awards.
In the next 2 consecutive years 2012 &amp; 2013 Vietravel continued to receive the title “Best Travel Agency – Vietnam” from TTG.
On top of that, Vietravel became the first and only travel company in Vietnam who won the World Travel Awards 2013.
The greater the honor, the greater the responsibility to maintain its leading position and the values that make the company as it is now: professionalism, inspiration, added values.
If one thinks about top 10 most significant events of Vietnam tourism industry in 2013, Vietravel deserved to be the owner of one among those.
Vietravel has arrived at the beautiful age of 18, energetic and matured enough to write up extraordinary stories for Vietnam tourism.
Happy birthday to Vietravel. The pioneer will always be the leader representing the pride of Vietnam, the pride of Vietravel.

Con Vanh- new destination in Thai Binh
Part of the Red River Biosphere Reserve which was recognized by UNESCO in 1994, Con Vanh Ecological Tourist Site is a famous destination.
Con Vanh a rich mangrove forest, a picturesque landscape, pristine beaches and natural tranquility.
The Con Vanh Ecological Tourist Site is located in Nam Phu commune.
Covering nearly 2,000 ha, it’s a relatively flat island, formed by the alluvial deposits built by the river over the years. In the past, people had to row a boat to reach Con Vanh because it is 7 km from the mainland.
Today, travelling there is easier thanks to a road connecting the island with the mainland giving visitors a more romantic way through mangroves and casuarinas forests.
Con Vanh is bordered by a sandy beach of 6 km.
Ta Hong Nhung is from Nghe An:“I was told that Con Vanh is a beautiful site.
When I came here, I found it superb.
The beach is clean.
The sand is not as white as that of other beaches but it is very smooth. It's nice to swim here”.
Ms. Vu Thu Hien is from Quang Ninh province: “Dong Chau, Con Den and Con Vanh are the three popular tourist site in Thai Binh.
Beaches here are beautiful, long and sandy.
The landscape is imposing. The air is pure and fresh. It’s very relaxing”.
Con Vanh has a rich ecosystem. Mangrove forests are inhabited by many rare birds. Brackish marshes are home to more than 200 marine species and 170 species of algae.
Tourists can sample various local specialties: shrimp, mussels, crabs and fish.
Local people are very hospitable.
Ta Thi May, a seller of seafood on the beach:"People here are very open and friendly.
That’s why tourists love to come back.
When the sea is calm, the water is clear.
Each place has its own beauty.
There are beaches good for swimming”.
In Con Vanh, there are no luxury hotels or restaurants, but clean air and unspoiled nature.
To Quoc Huong, Vice President of the Site Management Committee: "The Con Vanh beach stretches 6.8 km. It is beautiful and primitive.
As more and more tourists come, the site management committee has to focus on cleaning up the environment. We have also designated safe areas for swimming and created an emergency and rescue service to ensure the safety of tourists.
The site remains intact with its forests of mangroves and casuarinas.
We will focus on tourism promotion to make Con Vanh an attractive destination.”
To explore wilderness, enjoy fresh air and picturesque scenery, and meet hospitable people, visit Con Vanh before it becomes a tourist mecca!
Amateur singing in Kien Giang province
Kien Giang is an ideal place for those who want peaceful holidays.
It has beautiful islands and a primitive beauty.
Apart from the spectacular scenery and delicious cuisine, tourists should not miss the traditional amateur singing of Kien Giang.
Amateur singing is usually performed by local farmers who love folk music.
With the same lyrics and melody, each performer has his or her way of style.
Researchers said it is the open and free life style of the people by the rivers that is the basis of their improvisational singing.
Most of the local people are descendants of the reclaimers of the southern land, thus their songs contain sad melodies reflecting nostalgia for home and memories of their origins.
Nguyen Thi Thuy, a member of an amateur singing club in My Lam commune, said Kien Giang has 157 clubs with nearly 1,700 members.
Thuy said the club was set up to meet the spiritual life of local people: “The club operates once a month and attracts the participation of many local people. It helps preserve the traditional cultural values of this music style.
Amateur singing is typical of inhabitants of the villages along zigzagging rivers. It brings pleasure to them, helping them to relax after a hard day of work”.
In 2013, amateur singing was recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity. This helps not only to preserve this art genre but also to encourage local amateur singing clubs to develop.
The 2016 amateur singing and reformed theatre festival held in Hon Dat district, Kien Giang province saw the participation of 5 troupes with more than 30 local performers.
The Nguyen Trung Truc festival, held on 26-28 August of the lunar calendar, welcome millions of visitors.
Amateur singing performances at the festivals are always highly appreciated by the audience.
La Van Tai, a member of an amateur singing club in Rach Gia city, said: “Our club operates very often.
It is a chance for the people to meet and exchange songs featuring social and cultural values”.
Amateur singing is a form of entertainment unique for the Mekong River delta.
Nguyen Thu Huong is a tourist from Hai Duong province: “Kien Giang province has many tourist attractions. Apart from its beautiful scenery, the amateur singing is the thing that interests tourists”.
Amateur singing has existed and developed along with the life of people in Kien Giang.
It is an indispensible part of the spiritual life of the people there.
Exploring Ha Tien township in Kien Giang province
Ha Tien is a small township in Kien Giang province. Its 22 km coastline borders the Gulf of Thailand.
Ha Tien boasts magnificent landscapes which attracts lots of tourists.
In the middle of the 17th century, Ha Tien was a deserted region.
But from the 18thcentury, it became a busy commercial port.
In 1714, Mac Kinh Cuu explored the land and offered it to the Nguyen Lord, who later named the land Ha Tien. At that time, Ha Tien covered the whole of Kien Giang province and some adjacent areas.
Local historian Truong Minh Dat said: “The word Ha Tien derives from Ha meaning river and Tien meaning fairy.
Ha Tien means a river where fairies come to bathe on the full-moon day”,
Ha Tien has become famous for several beauty spots including Dong Ho swamp, a place isolated from modern urban life.
The swamp is surrounded with a range of coconut trees.
Mui Nai village, 5 km from Ha Tien downtown is home to the most beautiful beach in Kien Giang province and attracts visitors because of the peaceful waves and beach that inspires visitors to cover themselves with sand to absorb its minerals into their skin.

Inside the mountain is Tien Son pagoda, which was built of wood in 1790.
From the mountain side, visitors shave a panoramic view of Ha Tien township.
With its beautiful, peaceful landscape and rich culture, Ha Tien is a special attraction in the southern region.
Dao Thi Nuong, a tourist, says she loves the fresh air and tranquility of Ha Tien: “Ha Tien is also a destination for pilgrims.
From Ha Tien, we can go straight to Phu Quoc and Cambodia.
These three regions can be incorporated to establish a tourist route of the sea and islands, different from that of other 9 Mekong Delta provinces”.
Ha Tien is a meeting place for generations of southerners.
Despite the influx of tourism, the lives of the locals remain undisturbed and the town retains its peacefulness.
Ms Nuong again: “Ha Tien is different from other tourist places.
It has the sea, mountains and estuaries which are the advantages for developing tourism”.
The number of tourists to Ha Tien has increased.
With its unspoiled nature, rich culture and hospitable people, Ha Tien is undoubtedly a popular tourist destination in southern Vietnam.

Peaceful Tha village
Quiet, authentic, picturesque – Tha village is well known among tourists for its charm and peaceful beauty. Located just 2km from Ha Giang, Tha village stands out for its stilt houses, green bamboo groves and lush rice fields.

Building a house on stilts costs about 300 million VND but it's worth it because it is very comfortable and airy throughout the year.
Here in the village you can take an actual breath of fresh air and enjoy the warm hospitality of the people.
The Tay people are very warm and welcoming.

Hue- a romantic city
From 1558 to 1945, Hue was the imperial capital city of 9 Nguyen Lords, the Tay Son regime and 13 Nguyen dynasties.
During those 4 centuries, Hue became an extensive complex of unique architectural and cultural relics.
In 1993, the Hue imperial complex was recognized by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Site. The city has become a mecca of Vietnamese tourism.
On the northern bank of the Huong river in the middle of the city, the magnificent imperial citadel emerges, exhibiting the power of the Nguyen dynasty.
The citadel’s royal palaces, monuments and beautiful landscaping retain their imperial solemnity.
The Hue imperial city comprises the Imperial Citadel and the Purple Forbidden City which are surrounded by wide moats.
Several buildings were the headquarters of the monarchy and shrines dedicated to kings.
The Forbidden Purple City was reserved exclusively for the royal family and concubines. Only eunuchs could enter. The Imperial Citadel’s design was inspired by Oriental philosophy and Vietnamese tradition. All the structures were built around a main axis. The citadel has four main gates, the south door (Ngo Mon) was exclusively reserved for the emperor.
When you're in Hue, you should also visit the majestic tombs of the Nguyen Kings that lie west of the Imperial Citadel.
Located on hills, along the Perfume River, these tombs are typical of Vietnamese architecture, but each reflects the personality and taste of the Emperor.
A large part of Hue’s attractiveness is owed to its beautiful Perfume River and Ngu Binh mountain.
Nguyen Xuan Hoa is a Hue resident: “The Perfume River is a natural wonder of Hue city.
It has rare a romantic beauty.
Its green waters meander across the plains, through forests and villages like a silk band before entering the Tam Giang Lagoon".
Touring the Perfume River by boat is a wonderful experience. You will enjoy the beautiful sights of the city while listening to royal court music and local folk songs.
Truong Tien Bridge over the Perfume River is another iconic landmark of Hue. Built between 1897 and 1899, it was one of the first bridges built by the French in Indochina.
This beautiful bridge and the Perfume River have been a great source of inspiration for poets and songwriters.
Phan Thuan An has researched Hue culture for several years: "For Hue people, Truong Tien Bridge is the primary architectural site of the city and the most beautiful one.
The bridge is strongly imprinted in Hue people’s hearts”.
Today, the Hue imperial city is also known as a festival city because of its biennial festival which attracts top Vietnamese and foreign performing artists.
Authentic architecture, romantic landscapes, and delicate gastronomy make Hue city worth a visit!
Bai Dinh pagoda- a tourist destination
Located in Ninh Binh province, 95 km south of Hanoi, Bai Dinh pagoda has become a popular tourist destination in recent years.
The pagoda complex holds several Vietnamese records.
The ancient Bai Dinh pagoda sits 187m above sea level on top of Dinh Mountain.
Dating back over a thousand years, it is oriented towards the west and flanked by two caves. The pagoda nestles into one cave, which is not uncommon among old pagodas in Vietnam. To get to the pagoda, you have to climb 300 steps.
Do Ngoc Anh is a tour guide: "There’s a cave called Enlightened Cave. King Le Thanh Tong engraved ideograms there praising the beauty of the site.
The ceiling of the cave forms the solid roof of the pagoda which is dedicated to the Buddha and the Mother Goddess.
The altar in the cave is decorated with traditional Buddha statues”.
At the bottom of Enlightened Cave is a large exit which offers a great view of a distant green valley.
About 1 km from Bai Dinh pagoda is the complex of a new pagoda.
The new pagoda sits on Ba Dau hillside, overlooking Dam lake and the Hoang Long River.
500 Arhat statues flank the two paths that lead from the main gate to the shrine.
These paths which are about 1,700m long symbolize the Arhats’ path to Buddhism.
They are the longest Arhat paths in Asia.
Do Ngoc Anh: "The statues of Arhats were carved from blue stone by the artisans of Ninh Binh province.
Each statue is between 2 and 2.5 meters tall and weighs 2 to 2.5 ton.
They are placed on both sides of the path to guide the common people to the light of Buddhism.
The statues have different forms and different expressions reflecting all human moods: joy, anger, satisfaction, frustration.
At the foot of each statue is the name of the Arhat”.
The new Bai Dinh pagoda is a giant complex that extends from the main entrance to the sanctuary of Shakyamuni Buddha, the bell tower and the shrine to Kwan Yi, Buddhism’s Lady of Mercy.
The bell tower is built on three levels.
Octagonal in shape, it houses a 36-ton bronze bell which is the largest in Vietnam.
Just below the bell is a 70-ton bronze drum.
Local people believe that where they can still hear the sound of the bell, they are under the blessing of the Buddha.
The bronze statues of Kwan Yi and Shakyamuni Buddha are also the biggest ones in Vietnam.
The sanctuary of the past, present and future Buddha houses three huge statues of the three temporal forms of the Buddha.
Vu Anh Quan, a tourist from Dalat, is impressed by their size: “I had already seen those statues on TV and I knew they were enormous.
But the reality is far more spectacular.
These statues are gold showing their majestic and splendid side.
I am not surprised to learn that they hold the record for Vietnam’s largest statues of the Buddha, past, present, and future”.
The 6th day of the first lunar month is the main day of the pilgrimage feast of Bai Dinh pagoda. Tens of thousands of pilgrims flock to the pagoda to pay homage to the Buddha and visit this great site.
Lai Ngoc Nga is a pilgrim: "I make a pilgrimage to Bai Dinh pagoda every year.
This is a sacred place and we do not feel tired even after walking for many kilometers.
I always pray for health and luck for my family”.
Bai Dinh is a major attraction of Ninh Binh province, along with the Hoa Lu ancient capital, the Tam Coc-Bich Dong caves and Cuc Phuong National Park.
Tam Coc-Bich Dong’s charming scenery
Located 120 km from Hanoi, Tam Coc-Bich Dong is part of the Hoa Lu limestone mountain range.
For hundreds of years, the place has preserved the primitive beauty that has attracted countless visitors.
The Tam Coc complex includes Tam Coc and Bich Dong, which are situated in Van Lam village, Hoa Lu district, Ninh Binh province.
Recognized as a special national heritage, Tam Coc is often called ‘Ha Long Bay on the land’ for its system of limestone grottoes and historical relics from the Tran dynasty in the 13th and 14thcentury.
To reach Tam Coc, you must board a small boat at the wharf and get rowed up the sinuous Ngo Dong River past Xuyen Thuy cave and pockets of rice fields.
Do Thi Nu, a local boat pilot, talked to us about Tam Coc’s history: “In Chinese, ‘Tam’ means three and ‘Coc’ means cave, so ‘Tam Coc’ means three caves. In Vietnamese, it is called ‘Ba hang’.
Hang Ca is the first cave, ‘hang Hai’ is the second cave, and ‘hang Ba’ is the third cave.
It takes 2 hours to visit all three caves.”
Tam Coc is charmingly beautiful in any season.
In spring, bright green rice fields spread along the river banks, turning into silky yellow beds in the fourth lunar month.
In the summer while traveling on the Ngo Dong River, visitors will enjoy an enticing lotus fragrance while listening to the locals recounting legends about each cliff or mountain in the shape of a tortoise or dragon head.
There are particularly interesting rock formations, and schools of fish swimming in crystal clear water, but undoubtedly the most impressive features of Tam Coc are the caves, according to tour guide Nguyen Xuan Nguyen: “Hang Ca is the first cave and the largest of the 3. It is 127 meters long and its mouth is 20 meters wide.
Many stalactites hang down from the ceiling, some of which look like clouds and some of which drip water all day and are compared to a mother’s breast.
The cave looks very dark from the outside, but the further you go into it, the brighter it is.”
The beauty of Tam Coc is the beauty of the 3 caves with the Ngo Dong River running through them.
The second cave, Hang Giua, which is about 10 minutes from the first cave, has a length of 60 meters and a multitude of flat, horizontal stalactites.
The third and final cave, Hang Cuoi, is the smallest. It is about 50 meters in length and is only 100 meters from the second cave.
Its geology suggests this place was under the sea millions of years ago.
The land emerged gradually over centuries and waves eroded the limestone mountains to form grottoes.
After the 2-hour excursion returns you to Tam Coc wharf and go an additional 2 km to Bich Dong, considered the second most beautiful cave in Vietnam.
The Bich Dong area consists of a cave and a pagoda built on a limestone hill in 1428 under King Le Thai To.
Ms.Nguyen again: “Bich Dong pagoda is composed of 3 structures: Ha Pagoda (lower pagoda), Trung Pagoda (Middle pagoda), and Thuong Pagoda (upper pagoda).
In 1740, King Le Canh Hung named the pagoda ‘Bach ngoc thach son dong’ which means pagoda made of beautiful stones like a sapphire in a remote place.
‘Bich Dong’ means “green grotto”, a name given by Nguyen Nghiem, the father of the great poet Nguyen Du, in 1773.”
After praying to Buddha in Bich Dong Pagoda, visitors climb 21 stone steps to Toi cave (Dark cave) whose stalactites are shaped like fairies, errand-boys, hovering dragons, swimming tortoises, elephants, and tigers.
40 more steps take you to go to the Upper Pagoda, from where you can enjoy the best views of Bich Dong.
The view has strongly impressed foreigners like Monttie Binotto from Switzerland.
“This is my first time visiting this place, which is known for its cultural and historical tradition.
Tam Coc-Bich Dong is favored by nature with friendly people and charming landscapes.
I want to stay here for two or three days to fully explore it.
I’m impressed by the smiles of boat drivers who can row the boats with their legs.
I don’t think I can see these things anywhere else.”
Hanoi gates
Hanoi once had five gates which strongly embodied its historical developments. The beauty of these gates features in several songs about Hanoi.
According to historical records, there was a wall with gates surrounding the Thang Long citadel.
The gates were square and were under strict surveillance. They were open during the day and closed at night.
In King Le Hien Tong’s reign in the 18thcentury, there were 16 square gates, but by the early 20th century, there were only 5 gates: Cau Giay, Cau Den, Cho Dua, Dong Mac and Quan Chuong.
Some gates were pulled down because of war damage, but their names lived on as the names of districts or streets: Cau Giay district, O Dong Mac ward, O Cau Den ward and O Cho Dua ward. Today, only the Quan Chuong gate survives as a proper "square gate”.
Quan Chuong gate on Hang Chieu street, Hoan Kiem district, was part of the wall east of the ancient Thang Long citadel.
Covered with moss, the gate and part of the wall have survived the ravages of time.
On the gate there is a sign that says " Dong Ha gate” but local people prefer to call it "Quan Chuong Gate." Historian Duong Trung Quoc told VOV: "Quan Chuong is the only entrance to the city that retains its original architecture. There is a stele dating back to the Nguyen Dynasty in 19th century, which states that surveillance should be strict without disturbing the life of the people.
Why was the gate named Quan Chuong? It might be the name of a chief guard, who was so loved by the locals that they gave histitle to the entrance gate he guarded”.
Other historical sources say people called the gate Quan Chuong which means chief guard, to honor the Chief guard who led a hundred soldiers in a brave fight against the French in 1873, when they attacked Hanoi for the first time through this gate.
Quan Chuong gate exhibits a typical architecture of the Nguyen Dynasty.
It consists of two levels, the lower level has three arched doorways and the upper level is covered by 4 roofs decorated with a motif of hexagonal or quadrilateral asterisks.
The guards were stationed on the upper level.
Today, Quan Chuong gate exists as a page of history at the heart of Hanoi.
Truong Van Khanh lives near Quan Chuong gate: "We are proud to live in the neighborhood of Quan Chuong gate which has existed for centuries.
We hope it will be restored and preserved. It is a witness of Vietnamese culture and tradition of struggle”.
Quan Chuong gate was restored in 1804 and again in 1817, during the reign of King Gia Long.
In 1994, it was officially recognized as a historic relic site. In 2010, it was restored once again.
For Hanoians, Quan Chuong gate is not just a relic of the ancient Thang Long capital but a proud symbol of the modern capital city.
Visiting Yen Tu pagoda
The Yen Tu historical site stretches 20 km along Phuong Dong and Yen Cong communes in Uong Bi town of Quang Ninh province.
Nestled in the magnificent landscape, Yen Tu mountain is famous for the Bronze pagoda, which sits 1,068 m above sea level.
This tourist complex comprises pagodas, temples, towers and perennial forest.
In spring and summer many pilgrims go to Yen Tu to pay homage to Buddha.
Yen Tu, nestled in the middle of ancient pine trees is a special place, enjoying a deep stillness that allows visitors to forget about their daily cares.
Yen Tu is where several Venerable monks of the Ly and Tran dynasties including Hien Quang, Dao Van and the Most Venerable Tran Nhan Tong and Tran Thanh Tong, practiced Buddhism.
After ceding his throne to his son, King Tran Nhan Tong (1258-1308) retired to lead a religious life as a hermit. He founded the Truc Lam Zen sect and this place became the largest Vietnamese center of Buddhism.
The Most Venerable Thich Tue Phuc, Deputy Manager of the Truc Lam Yen Tu pagoda, says: “Yen Tu pagoda is closely associated with Truc Lam Zen.
In the 14th century, King Tran Nhan Tong, 3rd King of the Tran Dynasty, gave the throne to his son Anh Tong. 6 years later, at the age of 41, Tong moved to Yen Tu, where he founded the current Truc Lam Zen sect, a Buddhist sect that is purely Vietnamese”.
The Venerable Thich Tue Phuc says that in the summer, Yen Tu attracts not only pilgrims but also students who want to learn Buddhism:“Zen Buddhism is a branch whose main practice is meditation. During their summer vacation, students are sent here to discover Buddhism, while perfecting their morality to become good citizens”.
Formerly, to reach the summit, there was no choice but to climb the stairs and steep paths for two hours, which requires a good deal of motivation. Today, pilgrims can take a cable car up to the pagoda in less than an hour.
Le Trong Thanh, Deputy Director of the Tung Lam Cable Car Company, says: “On the weekend, the number of visitors increases sharply.
Our company tries to ensure the best services for visitors, guiding them to pagodas and temples”.
Many tourists prefer to walk up the mountain to enjoy the surrounding landscape.
From the Giai Oan (Clearing Unjust Charges) pagoda, pilgrims follow the stream to get to Yen Tu mountain.
The long road is dotted with places of worship like Hoa Hien Pagoda, Ngoa Van temple, Mot Mai (One Roof) pagoda, Bao Sai pagoda, and Vân Tien pagoda. Bach Hop, a pilgrim, says: “When we reached the Bronze pagoda, it was 5 o’clock in the morning. It was dark but we felt good.
Yen Tu is beautiful, clean, tranquil and peaceful”.
Ha Long Bay Cruises
The beauty of Ha Long Bay, which has been twice recognized by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site, always changes over the time.
Visiting Ha Long Bay at any time of the year, visitors are always amazed with its attraction.
Today’s Discovery Vietnam takes you on a tour of the Bay on the Golden Lotus cruise.
On board the Golden Lotus cruise are tourists from the US, Australia, Spain, Sweden and Vietnam. Leaving from Bai Chay port, the cruise takes them around the bay.
The beauty of the natural setting in the Bay blends with the blue sky and the cool breeze from the sea comforting its visitors.
Nguyen The Huu, a guide of the Khanh Sinh International Tourism Company, says: “During the one-day tour, tourists visit the Thien Cung (Heaven) and Dau Go (Wood Hidden) grottoes and then go to Ba Hang (Three Caves) fishing village for kayaking.
Then the tourists visit the Cho Da, Dinh Huong and Ga Choi islets and dock at Ha Long.
On the two-day tour, tourists have more time for sightseeing and to relax on the cruise.
The tour programs are diverse to give our tourists choices.
Our company focuses on service quality and the safety of customers.
We always try to refresh our tours and develop new services for our customers”.
Visiting Ha Long Bay by cruise, tourists can enjoy the complete view of the unique natural setting.
Sitting on the boat, enjoying a cool juice and gazing around at the scenery, with the thousands of islets of different sizes and shapes is the perfect choice.
John, a tourist from Australia, was visiting Ha Long for the first time. He said that the natural setting was unbelievable and that it was much more enjoyable to relax it on a cruise.
John said: "It's all inspiring, tranquil, eagles above, fish below, beautiful scenery, and incredible.
The caves are beautiful.
I thought they were little caves but they were real caves. They are amazing".
The most interesting and exciting moment is when the cruise docks at the fishing village and the tourists are free to go kayaking.
With assistance from the guide, all of us, even those who can’t swim, can find kayaking easy and interesting.
Each kayak accommodates 2 tourists.
Once they are in control of oars, they all are excited by kayaking.
John and his friend Tania are very happy with the whole experience. John says: "We can stay here forever, go around and around.
I really love the fishing village and the water as well as the nature and the human habitats.
While we're in the water, I want to stay here longer because it's actually great, a great experience.
I've never done that before.
It's so easy to get around, I was scared at first, but once I was in there, got the feeling, I could get around, up to the mountains. Look right up, you see the cliffs right above you.
It was beautiful.
I'd love to do that again."
In the afternoon, tourists had another unique experience.
They were taught how to make spring rolls, a traditional Vietnamese dish.
Mixing together all the ingredients: pork, vermicelli, wood ears, carrot, seasoning, eggs and wrapping in the rice papers is an exciting experience for many tourists.
Efarault, a French tourist, says: "If I can come to Vietnam to make some cooking. It's a good idea.
It is fun for everybody to meet around the table, try to prepare the dinner well.
It's fun. We meet people, share with people and have a nice dinner together. It's a good idea to do that".
When the night falls, the sea glitters with the light from all the boats making Ha Long Bay even more miraculous and beautiful.
Con Son - Kiep Bac: Museum of Vietnamese belief and culture
Con Son-Kiep Bac relic site in Hai Duong province has several historical and cultural relics reflecting Buddhism and Confucianism and national heroes of Vietnam.
Located 80 km from Hanoi, the complex is a destination to explore Vietnam’s history, culture, and religion.
Con Son pagoda was built in the 10th century and was expanded in the 13th century during the Tran dynasty.
In 1329, Venerable Monk Phap Loan, second founder of Lam Zen Sect upgraded the pagoda. His successor, Huyen Quang expanded the pagoda, taught Buddhism, printed Buddhist sutras, cast Buddha statues and developed Con Son into one of the three principal centers of Buddhist Truc Lam Zen.

In 1920, the old township was renovated by the French, who brought new construction materials and Western architecture. Laterite houses with stone columns and decorated with red lanterns blend harmoniously with traditional clay buildings.
Most of these houses belong to the Luong Huy family. Luong Huy Ngo of the Tay ethnic group says these houses are still in good condition: "The houses of this type are very comfortable.
It is cool in summer and warm in winter.
The wall thickness can be up to 85 cm. The wall part near the door is thinner, 65 cm.
To build such a house, it takes about one month with the help of six people divided into two teams. One team is responsible for carpentry and the other for masonry. The first team erects the wooden columns. Today, it is impossible to use only heartwood as in the past, so newer columns are less resistant. The second team prepares a kind of mixing clay”.
Located a hundred kilometers from the old quarter, the residence of Vuong, formerly named "Mong King Castle" is a major attraction in the region.
The residence, which covers nearly 1,200 square meters, is surrounded by majestic mountains.
It was designed by Vuong Chinh Duc, from a wealthy and powerful Mong family, who controlled the whole Dong Van region. Vuong Thi Cho is a fourth-generation descendant:
"The wages paid to architects and workmen to build the house were equivalent to 150 billion VND.
The materials were all from Dong Van.
You see, these two stone columns symbolize the poppy fruits.
The workers rubbed the stone columns with silver to give them a silver color.
Each column is worth about 900 million VND".
Besides the main building, the residence includes several houses for guests, as well as living rooms, a heating room, and an indoor stone pool for bathing baths in goat milk.
The owner constructed his residence as a fortress with tall fortified stone walls.
The three rooms of the main building are surmounted by stone blockhouses.
At the back, there is a large stone basin to collect rain water.
Ms.Cho says:
"Since Dong Van Karst Park was recognized by UNESCO, more tourists visit the residence. Each month, we welcome about 3,000 visitors and on public holidays, about 1,000 tourists a day.
From September, there are more foreigners arriving”
The original appearance of the Vuong residence and the old town of Dong Van district has resisted the ravages of time.
Ha Giang is appealing with beautiful buckwheat flowers
In late October, photo enthusiasts flock to Ha Giang province where the hills boast a beautiful white gown tinged with pink - the emblematic color of buckwheat flowers.
The history of buckwheat flowers is as old as the generations of the Mong ethnic minority group in Ha Giang.
It is said that in ancient times, a famine devastated villages. Since the land was barren, local people went in search of food. One day, an extraordinary fragrance appealed to the peasants. Among the rocks, they discovered small white pink flowers whose nuts tasted as subtle as rice and corn.
Since then, the Mong have used the buckwheat flowers’ nuts as staples like maize and rice.
Local people also make buckwheat cakes and wine.
Buckwheat flowers bloom from October to November.
Visitors will see rocky plateau decorated with buckwheat forests that extend over the Quan Ba ​​Dong Van, Yen Minh and Meo Vac mountain districts. The pure beauty of the flower dazzles nature lovers.
Mai Huong is a tourist from Hanoi:
“I’m very impressed with the landscapes of Ha Giang and its people.
They live here, in difficult conditions, trapped in the mountains and barren lands.
Here, even though the conditions are arduous, beauty is everywhere.
The meadows covered with buckwheat flowers are beautiful.
Everyone is impressed by this wonderful landscape”.
Yet this incredible beauty has completely fallen into oblivion.
It was not until social networks began to show off this beautiful landscape to tourists.
There are indeed photos posted on Facebook that have made buckwheat flowers of Ha Giang known to young people.
In order to promote the tourism potential of the region, Ha Giang authorities decided to increase the buckwheat fields to attract more visitors as possible.
A festival will be launched next November to honor the beauty of buckwheat flowers and promote the charm of the limestone plateaus.
Nguyen Van Tai is Director of VietSense Travel:
"We are among the first companies to have launched tours to Ha Giang. Everything is ready to welcome visitors in November and December.
The buckwheat blossom festival is a unique tourist feature for Ha Giang. The festival will help increase the number of tourists”.
The Buckwheat flower festival will take place in four districts of Dong Van, Quan Ba, Yen Minh and Meo Vac in the northern mountain province of Ha Giang from November 13-15. Go and discover this unique destination for yourself.
Quang Tri battlefield
Quang Tri province attracts visitors not only because of its beautiful landscape and delicious food but also its historical relic sites. The visitors come to the province to express their gratitude and show their respect to fallen soldiers.
Quang Tri citadel, Highway 9 Cemetery, and Truong Son National Martyrs’ Cemetery are the popular destinations.
War veteran Pham Xuan Thanh of Lang Son province often visits his fallen comrades in Quang Tri province in July.
Thanh was among the last people to leave Quang Tri province after the 81-day campaign to defend the citadel in 1972.
Thanh says Quang Tri was the battlefield where many of his comrades died.
When he visits his fallen comrades, Thanh often brings soil and water from his home village to sprinkle on the soldiers’ graves and into the Thach Han River.
Thanh says by doing so, he brings the homeland to the war martyrs:“Today, I come here to visit my comrades and release flowers in memory of them. I’m very moved every time I come here. I always remember my comrades and local people who died in this river during the war.
In Quang Tri province, there are 72 cemeteries accommodating nearly 650,000 war martyrs.
The National Highway 9 Cemetery and the National Truong Son Cemetery are located in this province.
All communes in the province have martyrs’ cemeteries, some of them have as many as 4.
Quang Tri citadel and the Thach Han River are considered an unmarked grave where thousands of young people fell during the war.
These days, war martyrs’ cemeteries in Quang Tri province receive a lot of visitors who come to pay their respects to fallen soldiers.
Ms.Nguyen Thi Hanh burst into tears when she visited Truong Son cemetery and Quang Tri citadel for the first time:
“I’m very moved and full of pity for the fallen soldiers. Their bravery is unimaginable. I’m very grateful to the fallen soldiers”.
People in Quang Tri have two occasions for showing gratitude: at the full-moon day in the lunar July when they express their gratitude to their ancestors and on July 27th, when they show their gratitude to fallen soldiers.
In July Quang Tri also celebrates the Highway 9- Khe Sanh victory and the battle to defend Quang Tri citadel in July 1972.
To mark the occasion, memorial and relic sites, and compassionate houses are upgraded and gifts are presented to social beneficiaries.
This year Quang Tri province inaugurated the Cua Viet Victory Monument built with 30 billion VND donated by social organizations, businesses and private donors.
In the “Sacred Homeland” program, commercial banks donated 100 billion VND to commemorative activities in Quang Tri province.
Nguyen Duc Huong is Vice President of Lien Viet Post Bank’s Executive Committee:
“We are thankful to the sacrifices of fallen soldiers.
Whatever we do or how much we do, we can never repay to their and their families’ great sacrifice.
We call on the younger generation to do their best to deserve our predecessors’ sacrifices”.
Nha Ruong- Ancient houses in Hoi Ky village, Quang Tri province
Hoi Ky ancient village in Hai Chanh commune, Hai Lang district, Quang Tri province is located by the O Lau river. The village is more than 500 years old.
Visitors to the village are amazed at the numerous ancient wooden houses known as Nha Ruong, religious establishments, and the peaceful lives of the local people.
Along road to Hoi Ky village are temples, pagodas and clan worship houses which boast unique architectural styles.
But visitors are most amazed at the centuries-old wooden houses nestled in large gardens along O Lau River.
These houses, which belong to the Duong family clan are comprised of 5 or 7 rooms and wing rooms and are made of thick solid wood. Their columns and doors are engraved with dragons, unicorns, phoenixes and other delicate patterns.
In each house, there are lacquered boards with parallel sentences teaching children to do good.
Doors between rooms are beautifully decorated.
The room in the middle is used to worship the ancestors while its two neighboring rooms serve living and bed rooms.
Of the other two wing rooms, the one on the west is for boys and the one on the east is for girls.
There’s also an entresol in the house that contains rice and other home objects.
Duong Van Cho is a local in Hoi Ky village: “Among the 20 ancient houses in the village, 6 have 3 main rooms and 2 wing rooms.
They are about 100 years old.
Local people have restored their houses and all want to maintain their identity”.
Depending on the size of the house, each roof has between 10,000 and 20,000 brick tiles made of clay. The tiles are rectangular, thin, flat and can produce a bell sound when they are knocked.
This way of tiling makes the house cool in summer and warm in winter.
Walls of the house are made of lime and wood hammered bricks.
Every house is surrounded by trimmed green tree fences.
Doctor Le Vinh An is of the Advisory Committee for Hue Ancient Capital Preservation:
“Hoi Ky ancient village still retains its values.
The village was founded in the 15th century but its houses are between 100 and 150 years old.
The landscape in the village is beautiful with a river zigzagging around the village, small lanes, wharves, and a communal yard.
These are typical characteristics of rural Vietnam”.
Mr. Duong Van Manh’s house which is comprised of 3 main rooms and 2 wing rooms and a roof with 10,000 tiles is the most typical. Named “Happiness convergence”, the house is situated in the middle of a large garden.
Built in 1889, the house is sustained with 48 jackfruit wooden columns.
Built in 1931, Ms Duong Thi Huong’s house has one main room and 2 wing rooms and covers about 60 square meters.
Inside the house, there’s a lacquered board saying “4 generations living in the same house”.
According to traditional beliefs, a house with 4 generations living together is a happy house.
Most of the houses in Hoi Ky hang a lacquered board with the word “Peace” on it.
Nguyen Thanh Nam is from Quang Nam province:
“The architecture of the houses is outstanding.
Their structures are also sustainable because they all have solid columns.
The roof of the house is low helping to protect the house from strong winds”.
The locals in Hoi Ky are proud of their houses which stand firm and retain their traditional values despite of war and climate devastation.
These houses have great historical, cultural and architectural values, according to Kitani Kenta, an expert from the UNESCO’s World Heritage Institute at Japan’s Waseda University. Kitani Kenta says the ancient wooden houses of Hoi Ky are wonderful, sophisticated and skillfully built.
These outstanding features need to be promoted’.
The Red Dao ethnic group in Ta Phin
Located ten kilometers from Sa Pa town, Ta Phin village is a popular destination for tourists.
The village is famous for traditional medical remedies of wild leaves made by local Red Dao people.
In Sapa, tourists can rent a motorbike to go to Ta Phin.
The first stop is the monastery of Ta Phin, or rather its remains.
Many tourists like to stay in the homes of local people to experience the way Red Dao people live.
In a wooden house, tourists help the hosts cook.
In the morning, they go together to the nearby forest to look for medicinal plants and visit the village.
In the evening, families and tourists sit around the fireplace chatting.
Dang Thai An and his children come from Hanoi. They spent three days with Ms.Phan Man May’s family.
An says he is enjoying this experience very much. This is the first time he has taken a trip without hotel or restaurant:
“It’s very interesting to live with the locals.
We eat, sleep and go to the field with the host family members.
We cook with them and have a bath using medicinal herbs like local Red Dao people.
They prepare a large pot of medicinal plants for us.
We are very interested in their tradition.
We go up the mountain and visit Ms May’s relatives.
It is really interesting”.
Dang Thai Vinh, Mr.An’s son has visited Sa Pa a couple of times. This time, he wants to introduce his family members to other interesting things about Sa Pa besides Ham Rong mountain, Cau May Street and Silver Waterfall.
Vinh said:
“I don’t want my family members to stay in the center of Sapa town because here the air is pure and good for health.
And above all, we have the opportunity to mix with Red Dao people to learn their culture, their customs and even their language”.
For a long time, on the last day of the year, Dao people has taken a bath with medicinal plants they pick from the nearby forest to welcome the New Year.
Having a bath with medicinal plants has become a tourist attraction in Ta Phin.
In a barrel of hot water, they put up to 120 different kinds of leaves.
Phan Man May says having a bath with medicinal plants is very good for health:
“These leaves are picked in the forest. When there is not enough, we have to buy them in the market.
Having a bath with medicinal plants, all our tiredness accumulated during the day is washed out. It will make you feel relaxed and help you sleep well. Tourists like it a lot.
In summer, it's easy to boil water, while in winter it takes us three hours”.
Adding medicinal leaves to the boiling pot, Dang Thai Vinh says he and his family members all feel relaxed after having bath with medicinal plants:
"This solution of the Dao people is great for health.
We had to walk 13 km to get here but after taking a shower with the water, we all feel perfectly relaxed”.
Staying in a wooden house nestled in the mist, chatting over a wood fire, having a shower with wild leaves- these unique customs and traditions of the Red Dao people give visitors to Ta Phin some beautiful memories.
Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve
Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve covers more than 3,000 hectares in Gia Vien district, Ninh Binh province.
This is a beautiful site that holds two national records for having the most Delacour's langurs and for being the largest unspoiled landscape in Vietnam. Van Long Nature Reserve is a popular eco-tourism destination.
Van Long is the largest wetland nature reserve in northern Vietnam.
On small bamboo boats, tourists travel through high reeds along small streams at the foot of the mountains to admire the reserve’s magnificent landscape.
Van Long is the most beautiful in the summer when the lotus flowers blossom.
Under the water, algae and other aquatic plants sway along with the rhythm of the oars.
Van Long is nicknamed “a bay without waves" because the water is as calm as a giant mirror reflecting mountains and clouds.
The reserve has a thousand caves, each with its own legend.
Do Thi Theu is a boat rower:
“From here, one can clearly see rough lines on the cliff from the top to the foot of the mountain which look like marks left by the claws of a cat.
This cliff is listed in the book of Vietnam Records as "the largest stone mass”.
Cua Chua mountain in Van Long is a place where explorers and researchers have discovered centuries-old drawings.
Tran Xuan Quang is Head of the Reserve Management Committee:
“On the cliff of Mount Cua Chua, scientists have discovered drawings.
Normally, they are not very clear, but when you pour water on them, you see drawings of men and women and ideograms.
It is a puzzle archaeologists are trying to figure out”.
The fauna and flora in Van Long typify the ecosystems of limestone mountains and Red River Delta wetlands.
The park has 39 fauna species and 722 flora species, many of which are listed in the Red Book of endangered species. A hundred bird species live there.
At dusk flocks of birds head towards marshes and rice fields in search of food.
But the real star of Van Long is the Delacour’s langur, one of the most endangered primates in the world. There are 40 Delacour’s langurs in Van Long.
Tran Xuan Quang again:
"Van Long has biggest population of the Delacour’s langurs in Vietnam.
You can see them on the mountains with your naked eye.
Even while sitting on the boat, you can see them.
The largest group of Delacour’s langurs lives on Hoang Quyen mountain.
In the early morning and in the afternoon, you can see monkeys eating or playing”.
The Dutch government, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Cuc Phuong Rescue Center for Rare and Precious Primates are involved in preserving the endangered animal species in Van Long.
Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve receives a large number of foreign every year, most of them from Europe or South Korea. Between May and September is the best season to explore the reserve.
Phat Diem Cathedral
Covering nearly 22 ha in Kim Son district, Ninh Binh province, Phat Diem Cathedral is a popular destination.
Built in the 19th century, it differs from other monuments because of its stone chapel, which is a very successful marriage between eastern and western architecture.
Along the way from Ninh Binh city to Phat Diem Cathedral, there are dozens of churches. But, Phat Diem is the most remarkable because of its unique architecture.
It was built at the initiative of Father Pierre Luc Tran, known as Father Six for 34 years from 1865 to 1899.
This priest built a large cathedral surrounded by five chapels, plus a campanile, a pond and three manmade stone mountains.
The whole constitutes an original set which Western Gothic architecture blends perfectly with that of traditional Vietnamese pagodas.
If we approach the cathedral from the south, we see a pond in the middle of which there is a statue of Jesus opening his arms wide.
Just behind it is a stone bell tower whose roof is curved like those on pagodas and communal houses.
The stone bell tower is built on 3 levels of large stone slabs and has 3 entries.
The first level, the largest, is made of square blue stones. It has 3 rooms with ceiling vaults, each has with stone bed.
Do Thi Ngoc Anh is a tour guide:
"The high arch symbolizes "round heaven" and the bottom stone bed symbolizes "the square earth", which perfectly matches the design of the Oriental concept of harmony between heaven and earth, between yin and yang.
The second level has a large drum and the third has a 1.4m high bell. Cast in 1890, this bell weighs nearly 2 tons.
Unlike other church bells that contain a pendulum, Phat Diem’s bell contains a wooden stick that helps the bell be heard 10km away”.
After crossing the campanile, we look up to admire the front of the Great Cathedral, which is the heart of the Phat Diem architectural ensemble.
It was built in 1891 with the official name of "Cathedral of Our Lady Queen of the Rosary".
Supported by 52 pillars in 6 rows, it includes 9 bays that celebrate the East-West architectural combination.
The entrance is exactly like a Gothic church with its raised ceiling, but the columns are carved with typical oriental motifs, including Vietnamese.
Do Ngoc Hung is an architecture student:
"I am very impressed by the altar of God.
The wooden walls are intricately carved and gilded. The altar itself is in stone. The carvings are superb.
I heard that the altar is made of 6 stone slabs in the basement housing the tombs of six bishops”
But the most precious jewel of the architectural ensemble of Phat Diem is the Chapel of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which some call "the stone church."
Do Thi Ngoc Anh told us:
"This chapel is almost entirely built of stone, blue stone extracted from Mount Nhoi in Thanh Hoa province.
Outside, there are two towers, one of which carries a relief showing the pierced heart of Mary which symbolizes the immaculacy”.
The altar of Mary is made of stone.
Vietnamese artisans carved various motifs on the stone including phoenix, lotus, pine, chrysanthemums, bamboo, and plum blossoms.
At Phat Diem, mass is held in the main cathedral. The surrounding chapels are dedicated to 4 different saints.
The chapel of St.Joseph was built in 1899. Its furnishings are made entirely of solid wood.
The quintessence of the ancient tradition of Vietnamese wood carving converges here.
Do Thi Ngoc Anh again:
"South of the main cathedral is the Saint Roch chapel which was built in 1895.
The altar is a monolith.
To the west is the St.Joseph Chapel, built in 1896 entirely of iron wood.
To the north of this chapel is the Saint Pierre Chapel, which was built in 1896.
The columns are made of jackfruit wood and are elaborately sculpted”.
Phat Diem Cathedral is a place of prayer and also a popular destination for researchers and tourists.
Dustin is from Canada:
"It's beautiful.
It's unbelievable that this church was built in the 19th century by the Vietnamese.
It is typically Vietnamese and completely different from any I have had the opportunity to see.
Every detail reflects a perfect symbiosis between stone, wood, East and West".
The vagaries of the weather have not damaged the famous architectural ensemble, but mosses have made it more charming.
Behind every relief, every stone lurks something mysterious and sacred waiting to be revealed to visitors.
Ninh Binh- the land of ancient capital
More than 90 km south of Hanoi, Ninh Binh is a province with rich tourist potential. The splendid natural scenery of Trang An, Tam Coc and Bich Dong, the stone cathedral of Phat Diem, and the forest of Cuc Phuong are among the attractions of this beautiful land which was the capital of Vietnam a thousand years ago. Ninh Binh has all the typical topography of northern Vietnam-mountain areas, foothills, coastal areas and low-lying plains.
Its diverse natural conditions favor countless plant and animal species, many of which are in the Red Book of Vietnam.
There are four large forests: Cuc Phuong, Van Long, Hoa Lu and Kim Son which together form a large biosphere reserve.
Ninh Binh is surrounded by mountains of limestone as strong as a fortress wall. It is probably for this reason that the Dinh, Le and Ly dynasties choose Ninh Binh for their capitals from 968 to 1010.
Hoa Lu, the capital was called "the capital built of stone" by local people.
Located at the center, Hoa Lu holds the remnants of wars against foreign invaders and a multitude of temples, shrines, and pagodas.
More than a thousand years ago, in these valleys covered by reeds Dinh Bo Linh led a popular uprising that wiped out 12 army troops.
In 968, he ascended the throne and set his capital at Hoa Lu.
Six kings succeeded each other from 968 to 1009 in Hoa Lu.
Do Ngoc Anh is a tour guide:
"The temples dedicated to the Dinh and Le kings have architectural and sculptural features of the 17th century.
The display objects dating from a thousand years ago.
There are pieces of earthenware bowls which were used at banquets given by the kings of the Dinh dynasty in honor of their victorious troops.
In the Trang An complex are the Trang An ecological site which has been named a World Heritage site, and Tam Coc-Bich Dong which is often called "Ha Long Bay on land." The Sao Khe River, which winds through the mountains, is the only thoroughfare in this area and the only means of transportation is a boat.
Limestone hills, valleys and streams alternate, creating a picturesque landscape.
Caves mesmerize tourists with their stalactites and stalagmites.
Bai Dinh pagoda, also in The rang An complex, is like a book of Buddhist architecture which holds several national records.
It is actually two pagodas: the ancient Bai Dinh pagoda and Bai Dinh pagoda complex- the largest pagoda in Southeast Asia.
The pagoda is built on a historic site where more than one thousand years ago, Dinh Bo Linh’s insurgent troops gathered before and after each battle.
Do Ngoc Anh again:
"Spring time between the first and third lunar month is the best time to visit Trang An. Then, the weather is neither too cold nor too hot.
This is the season of pilgrimage.
In Trang An, tourists and pilgrims can enjoy the scenery and visit the pagoda to pray for good luck”.
In Ninh Binh province, many villages have retained their traditional crafts: Van Lam embroidery, Kim Son mat weaving, Ninh Van stone carving, Phuc Loc carpentry and Van Long basketry.
A visit to Ninh Binh province will provide you with many unforgettable memories.
Museum of Ho Chi Minh Trail
Known as the "Ho Chi Minh trail", the supply route through the Truong Son mountain range is a legend of the Vietnamese resistance.
This story is now told in the "Museum of the Ho Chi Minh Trail”.
Poet Pham Tien Duat poet, a Truong Son veteran, wrote in the museum’s guest book: "We cannot lock up a mountain range in a house.
But the Museum of the Ho Chi Minh trail contains all the diamonds and precious minerals in this mountain range".
Located 16 km west of downtown Hanoi, the Museum of the Ho Chi Minh Trail boasts a contemporary architectural style.
It was inaugurated on April 10, 1999, on the 40th anniversary of Brigade 559, whose members built the legendary Truong Son trail crossing.
Director of the Museum Colonel Ngan Chai says the museum has a dual purpose:
to preserve and display objects used by the Vietnamese troops who fought on this trail and to commemorate the solidarity between the Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians involved in the struggle:
"The Ho Chi Minh Trail Museum is a continuation of the old Truong Son Museum which was established in 1968.
At that time, the museum’s staff were cadres and soldiers responsible for political and ideological education.
Their work helped galvanize the troops during the war".
Walking through the museum, you will learn about the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the route of strategic supply for anti-American resistance.
The museum covers ​​17,000 square meters and has three levels of exhibits on an area of 28,000 square meters.
At the entrance is a bronze sculpture representing the military corps which fought in the Truong Son mountain range.
Showrooms reproduce the chronological history of the Ho Chi Minh trail from the time when soldiers carried ammunition on their backs to the opening of paved roads in what the Western press called at the time "the labyrinth jungle”.
Colonel Ngan Chai said:
"In 1995, our museum changed its name to the "National Museum of the Ho Chi Minh Trail”. The museum inherited all the archives and all the artifacts of the Truong Son Museum.
We now have 20,000 objects.
Because the exhibition space can accommodate only 2000 objects, we organize regular exhibits to introduce all of our objects to the public.
We also organize mobile exhibits.
The Museum of the Ho Chi Minh trail fascinates visitors with its lively and creatively depiction of the exploits of the Vietnamese army.
In particular, the museum has a replica of a covered road, known as a K road, that was involved in the laser war.
Colonel Ngan Chai says it reflects the creativity of Vietnamese soldiers:
"These covered roads were constructed in the shade of the jungle. At the time, our troops often moved at night.
The US Air Force used lasers to detect Vietnamese military movements.
This is why the Truong Son soldiers had the idea of creating these covered roads to allow their vehicles to move during the day.
They bent branches of large trees or planted new trees and hung them with orchids to cover the roads.
In total, they created 3,000 km of covered roads.
This method had never been used before and was unprecedented in the history of war. It enabled Vietnamese soldiers to transport ammunition to the southern front”.
The Museum of the Ho Chi Minh Trail is Vietnam’s third most visited museum, welcoming tens of thousands of Vietnamese and foreign visitors each year.
Colonel Nguyen Hai Binh is Head of the Display and Communications Department of the Museum:
"Veterans, students and foreign tourists express their impression and sentiments for Truong Son soldiers.
Before coming here, many have read about Truong Son but visiting the museum brings them face to face with a legend.
For foreign tourists, Truong Son is not only a legend, it is also a subject of study.
They want to see all of our items".
These precious objects are closely associated with Vietnamese history and provide some excellent historical education for younger generations.
Hanoi Opera House
Located in the heart of the capital city of Hanoi, Hanoi Opera House is only a prominent example of French architecture but also a venue that frequently hosts major events.
The Opera House is a tourist attraction and the pride of Hanoi.
The Opera House is located at No 1 Trang Tien Street, close to the Restored Sword Lake.
It was once described by Japanese architects as the most beautiful architectural site in Southeast Asia.
Strongly inspired by the Garnier Opera House in Paris, this building was built between 1901 and 1911 with the help of two French engineers Travary and Savelon.
The Opera House’s theater, stairs, lobby and entrance door embody the European architectural style of the early 20th century.
The building has an area of 2,600 m2, a length of 87m, a width of 30m and a height of 34m.
The large front veranda overlooks the August Revolution square.
In the 870-seat concert hall, the seats are covered with leather or velvet.
The second and third levels have private boxes for VIP guests and families.
At the rear of theater, there are administrative rooms, dressing rooms, rehearsal hall, a library and meeting rooms.
Near the main hall on the first floor is the prestigious hall of mirrors for meetings and cocktails.
The Hanoi Opera House was renovated in 1997 to host the Francophone summit held in Vietnam for the first time.
Architect Hoang Dao Kinh aided the restoration work:
"Of all the architectural works in Vietnam, none has as beautiful and sophisticated zinc decoration zinc as the Hanoi Opera House. Needless to say, the restoration was very difficult.
We called for tenders from French companies, but their prices were very high at that time costing several millions of dollars.
So we decided to use Vietnamese artisans.
They were extremely competent. They created molds of 7-8 levels to restore the zinc decorations at a cost 4 or 5 times lower than that proposed by the French.
When French experts came to visit the Opera House after restoration, they all expressed their admiration for the Vietnamese artisans”.
Another challenge for the artisans was to restore the roof of the Opera House using stones from Lai Chau province instead of imported tiles.
With its restoration, the Opera House regained its extravagant beauty.
It is now a tourist attraction and a venue for concerts and art performances.
Nguyen Cong Cuong is a tourist:
"I’m very impressed with the French architectural style of the Hanoi Opera House.
It is located on a beautiful square surrounded by other French architectural sites but it is the most impressive".
For the Vietnamese, the Hanoi Opera House and August Revolution Square are historic relics.
On August 19, 1945, Hanoians gathered in the square for a huge rally and then headed to the Palace of the Special Envoy of the King to seize power.
Today, the Hanoi Opera House is also a venue for conferences and important meetings.
It is part of Hanoi’s previous architectural heritage.
Doing farm work in rural Hoi An
3 km from Hoi An, Tra Que village offers tourists a chance to stand in the shoes of a Vietnamese peasant, wearing a traditional conical hat and grow vegetables.
You can ride a bike from Hoi An to Tra Que village.
For the past ten years, the villagers have been welcoming foreign tourists who come to experience farming work.
Tra Que village which is famous for herbs grown with clean technology, is now a popular destination for tourists.
Do Thi Thanh is a farmer in Tra Que:
“Tra Que herbs are aromatic with small leaves.
It takes us about 20 days to grow and harvest them.
I grow vegetables for wholesale.
I have been growing vegetables for more than 20 years.
Herbs are often used with chicken rice, salads, mussels and eggs. Tourists come here to see and experience farm work.
We teach them how to plough the soil, apply fertilizer and water the vegetables.
Normally, it takes one hour to prepare the soil for a vegetable patch.
The tourists are very excited and happy. They like doing this job”.
The village has a hundred families who grow mainly vegetables and herbs.
Le Thi Binh is a local farmer:
“We never use chemicals, only water from the river to water the vegetables.
Vegetables and herbs grown here are very aromatic”.
Here, any villager can be your tour guide. All are hospitable and welcome you with open arms and a smile.
Farmer Ho Xuan Thanh explains why herbs from his village are so famous:
"The herbs grown here have a particular scent that cannot be found anywhere else.
The plants are small but packed with essential oils.
Our village definitely has special climatic and geological conditions. Also, we used no fertilizer but freshwater algae. The same varieties grown elsewhere do not have the same scent.
Tra Que village is not included in package tours, but it’s still a popular destination for Hoi An tourists.
Vuong Hoang is Director of the Cu Lao Cham Tour Company:
“Most tourists enjoy this tour because it’s a new experience for them. The vegetable village is an attraction for them.
They’re willing to spend 40 to 50 USD to be a farmer.
Vegetables here are naturally grown with algae so they have a special scent”.
Since 2004, Quang Nam provincial authorities have upgraded the village’s infrastructure and registered trade marks for Tra Que herbs to attract more tourists and protect the 400-year-old village.
It's been over ten years that the locals have been benefiting from this type of community tourism.
A visitor named Beth has just finished her work day in the field.
My Son Sanctuary: an attractive destination
My Son Sanctuary has been named by touropia.com as one of the 10 most attractive destinations in Vietnam.
The site was listed as a World Heritage by UNESCO in 1999 and is an outstanding example of the architecture of the Champa kingdom.
The scorching heat of summer doesn’t keep visitors from walking around My Son to admire the beauty of the temple.
The cool air inside the temple and the sound of cicadas singing outside the temple inspire the tourists.
Although many towers have been damaged, what remains is enough to amaze visitors, said one German tourist:
“This is the first time I’ve come here. I’m very happy because the temples here are beautiful.
With 70 buildings of brick and stone built between the fourth and thirteenth centuries, My Son was once the religious and political capital of the kingdom of Champa and the burial place of kings and monks.
In My Son, the object of worship is the linga, an upright stone and classic representation of Shiva. The temple worships Bhardresvara, founder of the King Amaravati region near the end of the fourth century.
Today My Son has thirty brick towers, although most of them are in ruins. This shrine is considered a museum where you can discover the culture of the Kingdom of Champa.
Architectural and sculptural works are mirrors of the minds of the Cham people, enabling us to understand their conception of the universe, life and death.
The sanctuary of My Son has been damaged by erosion and war. But the site has been reborn from its ashes to boast a unique beauty that attracts tourists from around the world.
Dat Chu, who lives in Ninh Thuan, told VOV:
"I’m very moved to visit the temple because it is here that I found my home. The site has become a heritage.
Champa culture is mysterious, diverse and original. Scientists have not finished unraveling all the secrets hidden in every brick and stone”.
In 2013, after 14 years of restoration, the public was allowed to visit temple G, one of the most important buildings at the site.
More than 60 objects from the temple were discovered and restored.
Federico, an Italian archaeologist who participated in the restoration of the temple between 2004 and 2005, said:
"Before participating in this project, I read a lot about Champa culture.
But seeing the temples with my own eyes, it is superb!
The restored work is beautiful. It's like a miracle”.
The My Son Sanctuary is a must-see in central Vietnam.
Just as picturesque as the famous temples of Angkor in Cambodia, the Bagan in Myanmar, or the Borobudur in Indonesia, My Son Sanctuary is a witness to the history of the Champa Kingdom and a World Heritage.
Pha Din pass- path for artilleries to enter Dien Bien Phu battlefield
Pha Din pass, which is 32 km long, is the gateway to Dien Bien province.
Its highest peak is 1,648 meters above sea level.
60 years ago, Pha Din pass was the place from which soldiers pulled the artillery up the mountain to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield.
The terrain of Pha Din pass now is not as difficult as before though there are still 8 sharp zigzag bends along the road.
Works has been done to lower the altitude of the pass and the width of the road has been expanded making it easier to go through it.
60 years ago, Pha Din pass was part of the pipeline supplying ammunitions and food to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield.
It was where 8,000 young volunteers, militia and workers carried ammunition and rice up the mountain everyday.
It was the place where ground forces and artillerymen marched through to Dien Bien Phu, whose secret name then was Tran Dinh.
Composer Hoang Van, who composed the song “Artillery pulling chant”, still remembers the marches through Pha Din pass 60 years ago: “Before entering Muong Thanh field, we had to go through a long zigzag pass on which some soldiers drove cars while other soldiers and laborers carried or pushed bicycles carrying supplies to the front.
The supply line began in late 1953.
The pass was dozens of kilometers and winding while French planes continuously dropped bombs destroying cars, trucks and bicycles carrying rice.
At that time, we had to be careful to avoid enemy bombings.
After that, we had to pull artillery up the mountain. All these experiences inspired me to compose the song “Artillery pulling chant”.
Pha Din pass was the most difficult section in the journey of moving the artillery. After Pha Din pass, the soldiers had to pull their weapons over many slopes, abysses and high peaks to move toward Him Lam base, Doc Lap hill, A1 hill and the De Castries tunnel.
The Dien Bien soldiers’ efforts to haul their weaponry are unimaginable.
Composer Hoang Van again:
“As we hauled our ammunitions, dozens of people were arranged at each end of it.
At one end, some people pulled the artillery and at the other end, some people pushed it.
We used a winch and put a roller inside to pull the artillery.
Every time we heaved, we elevated the artillery on the roller, so that it could a step.
Once the enemy dropped a bomb and broke the winch, and our supplies rolled down the abyss.
Our hero To Vinh Dien then plunged under the artillery to save it”.
It is now about dozens of kilometers from Pha Din pass to Dien Bien city.
But during the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the length of the road was not calculated by kilometers but by the hardship that the soldiers suffered.There were different roads for carrying supplies to carry artilleries to the battlefield.
Some roads were used for just a few hours for artilleries to go through and then hidden by the forest as if they had never existed.
There was a special section of the road that was 15 km long and built within 20 hours running distance from Na Nham forest to Ngheu hamlet.
On that road, Vietnamese soldiers manually pulled 2.4-ton artilleries, 75 mm canons and 120 mm mortars through difficult mountains, deep abysses and enemy bombs to join the opening battle of the Dien Bien Phu campaign on March 13, 1954.
Pham Duc Cu was a former artilleryman at Dien Bien Phu:
“Our condition was very harsh.
When we were 15 to 18 km from Dien Bien Phu, we had to pull the artillery manually.
It was the most difficult section of the road.
The Dien Bien artillerymen must have been made of bronze bodies and iron feet. We will never forget the winding roads and slopes in Bay Toi, U Mau, Suoi Ngua and Voi Phuc, where we pulled 2.4-ton artilleries up to the battlefield”.
A monument to the memory of hero To Vinh Dien and his artillery platoon was erected 20 km from Dien Bien.
The monument reminds younger generations of Vietnam’s glorious history and the heroic soldiers of Dien Bien Phu.
Kinh Bac- cradle of Great Viet civilization
Bac Ninh province is often referred to as the Kinh Bac- Northern region. The name is associated with a land with a long history and ancient culture. Previously, Kinh Bac consisted of Bac Giang province and Dong Anh and Long Bien districts of Hanoi.
The region is associated with several legends and is considered the cradle of the great Viet civilization.
Located in the center of the Red River Delta, Kinh Bac is blessed with fertile land, beautiful landscapes and favorable conditions for economic and cultural exchanges with other localities throughout the country. Since the early years before Christ, the region was one of the cradles of the wet rice civilization and the founding place of the Great Viet civilization.
It is home to several relics, pagodas, towers, temples and stupas which were built under several feudal regimes.
Kinh Bac is also famous nationwide for its folk festivals, especially Quan Ho folk singing, which was recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.
Kinh Bac inspires visitors with its cultural and historical vestiges.
Dinh Bang village in Tu Son district is home to the stupas of 8 Kings of the Ly dynasties, Co Phap temple and Do temple, which worships 8 Kings of the Ly Dynasty from the 11th to the 13thcentury.
Nguyen Thac Kim is from the Management Board of Do Temple Relic:
“The Ly dynasty built a unified monarchy, a unified country, and a unified government. The Le dynasty also set up social, economic and cultural establishments contributing to the development of Vietnamese culture and civilization and the army.
During peacetime, people cultivated crops. In wartime, they served as soldiers.
With such policies, the Ly dynasty developed a strong economy and successfully defended the nation”.
King Duong Vuong’s stupa and the Temple of Lac Long Quan and Au Co in A Lu village, Thuan Thanh district are also popular destinations.
The Luy Lau ancient citadel with market streets, temples and tower pagodas shows that this area used to be a political, economic, trade, Buddhism and Confucianism center of Vietnam.
Thuan Thanh is also the home of various traditional crafts and folk arts such as the folk paintings of Dong Ho village, the Ca Tru singing of Thanh Tuong village, and water puppetry of Bui Xa village.
There are many relics in Thuan Thanh that are closely associated with the history and development of Buddhism in Vietnam including Dau pagoda and But Thap pagoda, which has several Buddha statues and valuable antiques reflecting Vietnamese people’s creativity in architecture and sculpture.
Nguyen Huu Nam is a cultural officer in Thuan Thanh:
“But Thap is one of Bac Ninh’s most ancient pagodas.
There are several architectural structures and sculptured works typical of the 17th century in the pagoda. They include the wooden statue of Bodhisattva Kuan-yin of a thousand eyes and hands and Bao Nghiem stone-sculpture tower, known as Pen Tower.
But Thap pagoda is one of the few that retains its ancient style.
Kinh Bac was the center of national defense and cultural development during Vietnam’s feudal regimes.
There is also the Bac Ninh Temple of Literature which honors more than 600 laureates of Bac Ninh, one third of the laureates nationwide under the feudal regimes.
Kinh Bac civilization is also reflected in the tradition, customs and lifestyle of the local people.
Nam Yet- a coconut island
Located in the north of the Truong Sa (Spratley) Archipelago, in Khanh Hoa province, Nam Yet island is called the “Coconut island”.
From afar, the island is like a blue silk strait with ranges of coconut trees.
With a width of about 200m and a length of 600m, Nam Yet island is oval-shaped.
Trees typical of Truong Sa archipelago are planted on Nam Yet island but coconuts are the most numerous.
Colonel Phan Van Dich, Deputy Head of the Logistics Department of Brigade 146, who has worked on the island for nearly 30 years, says that the soil on Nam Yet island is good for growing coconut trees: "When we arrived on the island, coconut trees were already there.
The elders told us that those coconut trees came from the mainland.
They are becoming more numerous as Nam Yet now grows seedlings to plant on other islands of the archipelago”.
It is difficult to count the number of coconut trees growing on the island but it is certain that the care given to these plants is an art that takes time and work.
Colonel Nguyen Van Tam, a Political Commissar of Group 1 on the island says that Nam Yet is paying closer attention to growing coconuts.
Dry and stunted coconuts will be nursed and when they are 30 cm high, will be transplanted to a garden.
Coconuts here are planted at 2 times: in the spring and whenever soldiers leave the island, because they want to plant a coconut tree as a souvenir. Tam says:“I ​​was stationed on the island twice and I planted six coconuts.
Our team has planted another 14 coconut trees.
It takes time and efforts to grow coconuts even if the tree does not require much watering.
When the plants are large, we must remove dead leaves and place on top of the coconut a small packet of salt to make it produce more fruit and prevent disease.
Coconut trees are resistant to the harsh climate on the island.
They produce fruit throughout the year and particularly during the dry season.
A tree can provide 2 to 4 clusters coconuts.
Colonel Bui Van Thanh, Political Commissar of Group 3 on Nam Yet island, says:
"Our group has planted nearly a hundred coconuts, of which 50 are already yielding fruit.
We reap the fruit only on special occasions such as Tet or during visits by people from the mainland. We never count them but coconuts are numerous.
In recent years, the coconut trees gave many fruits thanks to good care”.
Products made from coconut trees are popular on the island.
The leaves are used to cover vegetable gardens and animal shelters.
Dried coconuts are used to scoop water. Some skilled soldiers even embed shells to make nice gifts for their family and friends.
Colonel Tran Dinh Hoa is the Political Commissar on Nam Yet island:
“We take good care of the coconut trees because they provide water and food for our soldiers.
Coconuts make the island green and they are strong enough to withstand the harsh conditions on the island.
Coconut trees are a symbol of Vietnam, representing Vietnam’s national sovereignty”.
Coconut trees stand majestically to protect the island from waves like the soldiers who spare no effort to defend national sovereignty.
My Son Sanctuary: A unique and majestic heritage of humanity
Located in the central province of Quang Nam, 69 km southwest of Danang, the My Son Sanctuary is nestled in a closed valley.
With 70 towers embodying the historic, cultural, architectural and artistic values of Champa civilization, My Son is comparable to the most famous heritages in Southeast Asia including Borobudur of Indonesia, Pagan of Myanmar, and Angkor Wat of Cambodia.
My Son was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999.
Built in the 4th century, My Son was once the religious and political capital of the Champa Kingdom and the burial place of kings and monks.
Architect Kazimiers Kwiakowski, who has studied My Son architecture for several years, says that from the 4th to the 13th century Cham people built this magnificent architectural work with their souls and hearts.
He describes the museum as a special sculpture museum of humanity.
Within a radius of 2 km, towers and tombs in My Son reflect architectural influences of Indian religion.
There is one main tower in the middle and several smaller towers surrounding.
The main tower worships the Linga or Shiva statue.
In front of each tower, there is a place to arrange offerings and conduct ceremonial rituals.
All towers have a pyramidal roof and face east to receive sunlight.
Many towers are decorated with genie statues and beautiful patterns.
Huynh Tan Lap is Vice-President of the My Son Relic Management Committee.
"Hinduism is the religion practiced here.
The religion worships three main gods in the abstract form of the Linga and Yoni, which symbolize Yin and Yang.
In the Sanscrit language, Linga and Yoni represent masculinity and femininity.
The religion reflects the idea that there is Yin and Yang in the universe.
The Linga and Yoni are the main worshiping objects in the main temple."
Most of the towers are built of brick with a sophisticated technique.
Stone pillars are decorated with bas-reliefs of sandstone depicting scenes from Hindu mythology. These are delicate and expressive sculptures reflecting the Champa arts.
Dat Chu, a Cham in Ninh Thuan says:
"Champa culture is diverse and rich.
Researchers never finish discovering the secrets of Champa culture hidden in every brick and stone.
Not only me but all the Cham in Ninh Thuan are very proud”.
The architecture of My Son is the quintessence of Champa culture and arts.Wu Shang is a Chinese tourist: "I ​​went to Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An and My Son because there are only a few world cultural heritage sites left.
I have visited several shrines in the world but I must say that My Son is particularly well preserved."
My Son is known as a beautiful cultural treasure of the ancient Cham people and a lively architectural museum of the aesthetics of humanity.
Despite ravages of war and time, My Son Sanctuary stands as a witness to the history of the ancient Champa, and is an important part of the world’s cultural heritage.
Hoi An in the eyes of foreigners
Hoi An ancient town with it mossy houses, wooden bridges and ancient wells dating back 3 centuries is always a magic magnet for both Vietnamese and foreign tourists Reputed to be the most charming town in Vietnam, Hoi An has become a key destination for foreign tourists passing through central Vietnam.
The first thing that strikes visitors upon arriving in Hoi An is the feeling of returning to the 16th century because of its ancient architecture, peacefulness and hospitality. There are no horns.
Motorbikes are banned from 8:00 to 11:00, from 14h to 16h30 and from 18 h to 21 h.
This makes the city more peaceful and beautiful at meal time.
Mara Landoni, an Italian architect, thinks Hoi An is most beautiful in the morning:
“I like walking around the town in the early morning when the street is not crowded.
I like to see people opening their shops.
It’s the best moment for me ".
In the morning, Hoi An seduces you with cobblestones, mossy houses and flowering bougainvillea.
Kiara is another Italian tourist. She visited Hoi An after hearing about this magical place: “I think it’s very beautiful and amazing.
I like the architecture of the old town.
I like local people. They are very friendly”.
Kiara’s impressions are shared by her son Francesco, who spent an unforgettable few days in this ancient Vietnamese town: “It’s very nice.
I like the lanterns lights and many things. I like all the places including pagodas. Our guide show us many interesting things”
If Hoi An is fairly quiet during the day, in the evening, it comes alive and sparkles in the lights of lanterns.
Tourists usually prefer Hoi An at night.
Sandra is a Latvian tourist:
At night, Hoi An is quite different.
The streets are lit by the light of candles and lanterns. It is absolutely beautiful.
" Every street corner and house is decorated with colorful lanterns made by the local people.
Walking along the small lanes, listening to the sounds of wooden windchimes, melodious music on the street corners, and chanting on the Hoai river, visitors grow more and more enamored with Hoi An.
Nguyen Su is Secretary of the Hoi An Municipal Party Committee:
“In the ancient streets at night, you have the feeling that everything is moving more slowly.
Walking around the streets, smelling the fragrance of aloe wood and listening to the unhurried sounds around you make you feel more relaxed.
The ancient town is like a stage play”.
Full moon nights are particularly conducive to exploring Hoi An. When night falls, the town lights its lamps and is filled with delicious odors.

There are lanterns everywhere.
Both children and adults like vividly bright lanterns.
Thousands of decorations to go along with the lanterns are also on sale.

Vietnamese donut
‘Banh ran’ is a delicious finger food for breakfast in Vietnam.
There are two main kinds of banh ran, namely salty cake and sweet one with the latter being much more common than the former.
While the filling of sweet cake is sweet mashed mung bean, that of salty cake is quite similar to pillow cake‘s, a mixture of minced meat, prawn, glass noodle, veggie.
What is more, among different types of sweet cake, the cake coated with sesame seeds is the best choice due to its moderate sweet taste, crispy cover and subtle fragrant.
The dough is a blend of glutinous rice flour, rice flour, mashed potato and sugar.
Mashed mung bean filling is rolled into ball shape, wrapped inside the dough and then rolled over a plate of sesame to make its sesame coat.
After deep-fried, the cake is getting golden brown, crispy and aromatic.
Hiding under that crispy cover is the sweet and nutty flavor of potato, rice, and mung bean.
So just relish it and discover how tasty it is!
Ganh Da Dia - Giant “beehive” in Phu Yen sea
Ganh Da Dia, which means Sea Cliff of Stone Plates, is a seashore area of uniformly interlocking basalt rock columns located along the coast in An Ninh Dong Commune, Tuy An District, Phu Yen Province in central Vietnam.
The area is about 100 meters wide and 250 meters long, composed of an estimated 35,000 columns of basalt rocks.
The rocks are dark lava columns with roughly flat surfaces of different shapes - round, pentagon, hexagon, polygon...
Ganh Da Dia looks like a gigantic beehive or pile of dinner plates, hence the name.
The rock columns were created from volcanic eruptions millions of years ago; when the molten basalt flows met cold water, they solidified and created polygonal formations due to thermal contraction.
Ganh Da Dia was listed as a National Heritage site in January 1998 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
Hectic Tuy Hoa fishing port at dawn
Visitors traveling to Tuy Hoa fishing port located in the coastal city of Tuy Hoa in Phu Yen Province at around 5 a.m. will have a chance to see how local fishermen begin the day early in the morning.
The fishing port is among the hectic trading places in the coastal city.
To local fishermen and traders, this is the most significant time when fishing boats laden with seafood return to the port after fishing trips.
A lot of baskets full of freshly-caught seafood are transported ashore one after another by suntanned men whose weather-battered faces always show happiness for their work.
Meanwhile, traders swiftly pick some baskets containing the freshest seafood and then deliver to many other places.
The fishing port is also very famous for the best tuna with certain ones weighing up to hundreds of kilograms.
Heading for the trading area situated right in the port, visitors will get amazed by the bustle and hustle of buyers and sellers.

They can also admire the beautiful sunrise over the horizon and fishing boats busily checking in and out at the same time.
Despite hard work under the sun, Phu Yen fishermen always give a broad grin on their faces.
To them, every fishing trip full of fish is a great happiness in the daily lives.
New life for Mekong floating market
The Mekong Delta province of Hau Giang is developing eco-tourism products based on its rivers, fruit orchards, and rural sights and life, according to its Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
They include Nga Bay floating market in Nga Bay town, an ecological tourism zone in Vi Thuy District and agriculture tourism in Vi Thanh city.
Do Chieu Qui, the department’s director, said the province was undertaking a 35 billion VND (1.5 million USD) project to revive Nga Bay floating market for tourism purposes.
The market would be turned into one of the province’s key river tourism products, he said.
Since the floating market was established in 1915 it was located at the meeting point of seven canals and rivers in Nga Bay town and become one of the delta’s busiest markets.
But a decade ago local authorities moved it to a new site three kilometres away to improve traffic safety at the confluence, and the market’s activities began to dwindle because of the inconvenient location.
The project to revive it is expected to be completed in 2019.
At the 145ha ecological tourism zone, several tasks have been completed, including the dredging of a 14km canal and creation of a 13ha fruit orchard, 5ha bird garden and 11ha area for breeding wild animals and freshwater aquatic species.
The zone is expected to be ready by the end of 2018, according to the department.
The department is also working with relevant agencies and district authorities to conserve and develop historic and cultural relics, including the Temple of Uncle Ho, Can Tho Party Committee base and Relics of Chuong Dien Victory.
The province has also set up community tourism sites at the Cau Duc pineapple farming area in Vi Thanh and Long Tri sweet mandarin area in Long My District and developed agricultural tourism in Vi Thanh.
Hau Giang has zoned off a 130ha eco-tourism area at the Mua Xuan Agricultural Centre in Phung Hiep District.
It also plans to develop eco-tourism at the 2,800ha Lung Ngoc Hoang Nature Wetland Reserve in Phung Hiep.
Hau Giang, located in the delta’s central part, hopes to attract 160,000 tourists a year, including 18,000 foreigners, by 2020, according to its tourism development plan.
Speaking at a meeting on August 12, the province’s Party Committee Secretary, Tran Cong Chanh, told local authorities to continue surveying sites so that appropriate tourism development plans can be made and human resources developed.
The investment to develop eco-tourism sites should be linked with the national programme to build new rural areas, he said.
The Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism should monitor and provide advice during the process of creating eco-tourism products at the Mua Xuan Agricultural Centre, he said.
After two years of implementing the province Party Committee’s Resolution No. 9 on developing tourism, Hau Giang has also organised many tourism training courses for households in eco-tourism areas.
On August 3, for instance, 40 farmers in Vi Thuy District were provided training in tourism.
The trainees also visited a community tourism model in the district.
Le Quoc Chien, who has participated in a tourism training course, offers tourism services in his 1ha fruit orchard in Vi Thanh.
He grows many kinds of fruits like durian, mangosteen, jack fruit, red flesh dragon fruit, mango and guava and also has ponds for tourists to fish.
Le Minh Tam of Nga Bay town’s Nga Bay Ward developed his 5ha Burmese grape orchard into a tourism site in 2014.
It receives about 100 tourists a day, and 300-400 during the peak Burmese grape harvest season.
Tam has tied up with travel companies in HCM City and Vinh Long and Kien Giang provinces to bring tourists to his orchard, which has fruits between April and September.
“I plan to replace old Burmese grape plants with other trees like king orange and rambutan to ensure my orchard has fruits year round.”

5 experiences not to be missed in Vietnam
There's no point dipping your foot in the water; you have to dive right in on a trip to Vietnam.
Vietnam boasts an abundance of beautiful sights to behold and delicious food to taste.
But if time is not your friend, here are five must-visit destinations that will guarantee you a trip to remember.
Taking a train to Sapa
Sapa is a small town in the northern province of Lao Cai.
Dubbed the "the Tonkinese Alps", the region is home to hill tribe minority groups who farm on terraced rice fields.
Mount Fansipan, the roof of Indochina, stands tall at 3,143 meters right in the center of the Hoang Lien Son mountain range not far from Sapa.
Taking a train from Hanoi to Lao Cai.
The town, 376km north of Hanoi, is easily accessible by an overnight train from the capital.
One can take a bus too, but such a long journey is usually reserved for those with a thirst for adventure.
The train, on the other hand, is safe, cheap and convenient while still affording you a breathtaking view out of the window from a cabin that still breathes the air from the French colonial period.
If you opt for the train, tickets should be booked at least a few days or even months in advance, especially if you plan to travel during public holidays such as Labor Day on May 1 or National Day on September 2.
Drinking ‘bia hoi’ with locals
‘Bia hoi’, roughly translated as fresh beer, is a locally-brewed, preservative-free beer served at small bars and at street corners.
A visit to Hanoi is incomplete without a stop at the ‘bia hoi’ corner at the crossroads of Luong Ngoc Quyen, Ta Hien and Dinh Liet streets for a glass of 20 cent beer.
Most ‘bia hoi’ joints also serve inexpensive street food that goes well with the beer.
There are prawns barbecued with chili and salt, clams steamed with lemongrass, green mango with a prawn-chili-salt dip or coconut snails sautéed with butter and fish sauce.
Instead of a “proper” table, you’ll find yourself seated on tiny plastic stools, most likely blue, which also serve as mini tables.
As the alcohol kicks in, you’ll soon forget the discomfort in your legs to cheer the night away.
Overnight cruise in Ha Long Bay
Ha Long Bay, the famous UNESCO World Heritage Site, is not to be missed in the northern province of Quang Ninh. Spanning an area of 1,553 km2, the bay features thousands of limestone karsts formed over 500 million years and 2,000 islets that come in all shapes and sizes. You can venture out onto the waters in a kayak, descend into mysterious caves or discover your own secret hideout among the thousands of islets.
The sunrise or sunset on a cruisewould take your breath away.
Travelers can book an overnight cruise that comes with a double room, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
As the sun comes up, you will be treated to piercing limestone karsts rising majestically out of the bay.
By evening, a candlelight dinner awaits you onboard under the stars and the moon, lighting the way for small fishing boats heading out for the night.
Hoi An food heaven
Inside the ancient town of Hoi An lies a whole new world for you to discover. And it’s not just 16th century houses for which this former port city has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage.
On its small sidewalks and inside unassuming houses there are 1,001 street food specialties awaiting you.
Here are just a few to add to your bucket list, because you won’t find a cheaper or tastier equivalent anywhere else:
- ‘Mi Quang’, or Quang noodles, the central sister of pho, just bigger and with a pulpy rather than silky texture
- ‘Hen xuc banh trang’: Vietnamese burritos - sautéed clams eaten with crispy rice paper
- ‘Cao lau’: Brown noodles with pork and greens, only in Hoi An
Floating market in Mekong Delta
The Mekong Delta down south is criss-crossed with thousands of canals interlocking through fields and mangrove forests that have created a world of their own: life on water.
Put your bike aside and jump in a boat to discover tropical fruits on offer at floating markets.
The most famous ones include Cai Rang (Can Tho Province), Cai Be (Tien Giang Province), Phung Hiep (also called Nga Bay in Hau Giang Province), Long Xuyen (An Giang Province) and Tra On (Vinh Long Province).
Floating markets have long been the iconic feature of the Mekong Delta.
In the midst of hundreds of boats anchored next to each other, you’ll find huge crowds of buyers and seller bargaining over fruit, fish, poultry, fabric, home appliances and farming tools.
The goods are hung on long bamboo polls for customers to choose from.
For the more adventurous, you can go snake and snake wine shopping in Phung Hiep Market.

Tourists who reach Ke Go can now take a boat to take in water pouring down from the mountain, have a picnic along the banks and enjoy grilled fish, a specialty of the region.
Tuyen Lam Lake, Lam Dong
No one knows for sure when and why the lake was called Tuyen Lam, but many think that Tuyen stands for stream and Lam stands for forest.
Tuyen Lam is a place where water and trees meet.
Located in the Central Highland province of Lam Dong, where the dry season lasts up to six months, the lake is full of water all year round.
If viewed from the cable hanger above, Tuyen Lam Lake is as a miniature ocean with each island oasis on the lake representing a continent.
Here tourists have a chance to enjoy the cool highlands air, explore the cultural patterns of ethnic groups and join in exciting activities like elephant riding.
To Nung Lake, Gia Lai
Located six kilometers north of downtown Pleiku in the Central Highland province of Gia Lai, To Nung Lake is in fact a volcanic crater formed millions of years ago.
The lake has a surface of 280 hectares (692 acres) and an average depth of 16-19 meters, reaching 40 meters at its deepest.
Visitors can discover To Nung Lake by boat, but they can also choose to enjoy the beautiful landscapes from the back of an elephant.
In the evening, they can share a dance, a song or some wine with local ethnic people while listening to their traditional music.
Romantic Bo Bo Pine Forest
Around 25km southwest of Da Nang, the Bo Bo Pine Forest is situated in Dien Tien Commune in Quang Nam Province’s Dien Ban District.
The forest consists of 4 small hills located in an area covering more than 200ha.
The forest boasts romantic natural landscapes thanks to its beautiful pine trees, birds singing, peaceful lakes, and year-round cool weather.
Tran Van Dung, a local young photographer, is a typical example. He said “I accidentally saw Bo Bo Pine Forest when I was on my way to Dai Loc District.
I was mesmerised by the forest’s amazing natural landscapes, and decided to take some photos and upload them on my Facebook page.
Many people from my Facebook friends list were also deeply impressed by the beauty of the area, and they asked me to take them there”.
With the highest hill standing 55 meters above sea level, from its summit visitors can admire the amazing panoramic views over the northern side of Quang Nam Province, the eastern side of the province’s Dai Loc District, and the southern side of Da Nang.
Thanks to this, the area has now become a popular venue for backpackers and hotographers from Da Nang.
Nhat Lam Thuy Trang Tra ecotourism site - a peaceful and romantic venue
About 10km east of Da Nang, the Nhat Lam Thuy Trang Tra ecotourism site on the Son Tra peninsula boasts a simple, poetic beauty set amongst outstanding nature
The site’s owner, Mr Pham Truong Mai, said that the site was created in 2007 and was originally named ‘Truong Mai’ after him. A few years later, it was renamed ‘Nhat Lam Thuy Trang Tra’, which implies a beautiful natural area featuring mountains, water, green trees and grass.
Over recent years, Mr Mai and his family have taken advantage of the site’s natural conditions to raise wild boars and backyard chickens, farm fish, and plant wild vegetables. This has helped his family to increase their production activities, and become involved in protecting the forest.
Thanks to its beautiful landscapes and airy spaces, ‘Nhat Lam Thuy Trang Tra’ is now attracting a great deal of attention from local residents and visitors.
The path to the ecotourism site is quite romantic thanks to the green trees and grass alongside.
From the peninsula’s Ban Co Peak (Chess Board Peak), visitors need to go straight on until they meet a T-junction and then turn left. They continue going straight ahead for several kilometres until they come to the site.
Interestingly, some of the bends on the road leading to the venue will challenge drivers with their 40% uphill slope.
Visitors to the site have the opportunity to enjoy a wide range of delicious rustic dishes made from the backyard chickens, farm-bred wild boars, and wild vegetables.
Most notably, the coconut wine is highly recommended for people who love a light and sweet spirit which is fermented from coconut water.
New attractions for tourists
To create variety and novelty for visitors to Da Nang, many local young people are trying to develop new and special tourist attractions.
The ‘Chan Troi Goc Be’ (All Corners of the World) eco-restaurant is a typical example.
Located on Le Van Duyet at the foot of the Thuan Phuoc Suspension Bridge, the eco-restaurant is the perfect venue for anyone who wants to enjoy relaxing moments away from the hustle and bustle of the city, or interesting outdoor activities with their relatives and friends.
The 5,000m2 area features many spacious bamboo watch-towers which bring its customers relaxation, peace, and tranquility.
On display are mounds of straw and rice straw-woven items, as well as re-creations of images of rural areas.
In addition, visitors have the opportunity to be immersed in nature by participating in collective games on the spacious grassland or in water sports such as boat racing and floating water bike cycling.
Another example is the company MTV Nguyen-Eco which specialises in offering sea and island tours.
Mr Duong Van Nguyen, the company’s Deputy Director, said that Da Nang welcomes an increasing number of international visitors, but they seem to prefer to experience ecological tourism activities in Hoi An rather than take tours around the city.
Yet the city possesses many time-honoured traditional crafts which have great potential for the development of eco-tourism.
Included are the making of sedge mats in Cam Ne Village and bamboo knitting in Yen Ne.
He remarked, “To meet the increasing demand from foreigners for this type of tourism, my company has launched a ‘Nguyen Eco ecotourism’ tour along the banks of the Cam Le River.
Enjoying the tour, visitors will have the opportunity to experience sedge mat-making or picking vegetables themselves to prepare their own meals”.
Developing tourist attractions in Hoa Vang District
Over recent years, many domestic and foreign visitors arriving in Da Nang have been attracted to the rustic tourism products and tourist sites in Hoa Vang District.
About 20 km west of the city, the 186ha Hoa Trung Lake in the district’s Hoa Lien Commune boasts a peaceful and simple charming beauty with numerous artificial floating islands and smooth green grass.
During the days of shallow water in the summer, the lakeside area is larger and looks like a vast and quiet steppe.
According to a Vietnamese website, this place is as beautiful as the renowned Mongolian-Manchurian steppe.
Thanks to its impressive beauty, the lake has now become very popular with residents from Da Nang who want to take part in outdoor activities or stay overnight here with their friends and family members.
In addition to the peaceful lake, the district is famous for around 100 ancient houses which are all over 100 years old.
Amongst them, the 200-year-old Tich Thien Duong house in Hoa Nhon Ward’s Thai Lai Village has become a must-visit place.
This house keeps intact some of the unique architectural characteristics of an ancient traditional Vietnamese house, including a moss-covered roof, sophisticated carved patterns, and east and west-facing rooms in accordance with the ancient Oriental architecture.
In addition, many old utensils are kept in the house, such as a flour mill, rice mortar, cake mold and coal iron, and these reflect the rural life of the past.
A group from the municipal Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism and other local relevant agencies recently surveyed the new tourism products in Thai Lai Village.
The intention was to find ways to boost the development of the local river tourism with the aim of starting a new boat tour, developing new tourist attractions, and building a trip boat pier there.
The Han River-Tuy Loan Village-Thai Lai Village sightseeing boat tour will provide an opportunity for visitors to enjoy the beauty of the city’s bridges across the river, the La Huong vegetable growing area in Cam Le District, the Tuy Loan Village Communal House, the Tich Thien Duong house, and numerous fruit-laden orchards in Thai Lai Village.
In an attempt to develop tourism products featuring the special characteristics of the land and people of Hoa Vang District, Mr Nguyen Thuc Dung from the district’s Culture and Sports Office stressed the need to make the existing popular tourist sites more attractive to both domestic and foreign visitors.
Top priority should be given to promoting community-based eco-tourism in Thai Lai Village because this type of tourism will prove effective in this rural area.
Peaceful Hoa Trung Lake
About 20 km west of Da Nang, Hoa Trung Lake in Hoa Vang District’s Hoa Lien Commune supplies water for the daily lives and agricultural activities of local residents in the Hoa Son and Hoa Lien communes.
The lake boasts a peaceful and simply charming beauty with numerous artificial floating isles and smooth green grass.
During the days of shallow water, the lakeside area is larger and looks like a vast and quiet steppe.
Visitors to the site will also be impressed by the images of a Vietnamese rural village, such as herds of cows and buffalo eating on the grass, and white storks flying across the sky.
Thanks to its impressive beauty, the lake has now become very popular with residents from Da Nang who want to take part in outdoor activities or stay overnight here with their friends and family members.
In addition, the site is drawing a great attention from the city’s amateur photographers who want to capture the amazing beauty of the lake.
Local photographer Minh Tran said that he often takes photos at the lake, and sees many young couples from Da Nang visiting there to shoot beautiful photos before their weddings.
Ngoc (Ruby) Island - an attractive venue for outdoor activities
Located about 15km off the Da Nang coast, Ngoc (Ruby) Island is an excelllent place for anyone who wants to enjoy relaxing moments away from the hustle and bustle of the city, or fascinating outdoor activities with their relatives and friends.
The island is locally called by several different names such as Hon Chao, Hon Son Tra and Han Island.
It can be reached in 10 minutes by speedboat or 40 minutes by tourist boat from the Han River.
Despite being only 1.5km wide, the island features mountains, waters and large rocks heaped together.
It is home to diverse and rich marine animal and plant populations, including 144 species of corals, 135 species of seaweed, and 162 species of colourful fish.
Visitors to the venue can enjoy the sounds of splashing waves and wind whilst walking barefoot on the white sand.
In addition, they can take the opportunity to participate in interesting water sports, including jet-skiing, kayak racing, parachute surfing, and going fishing with local fishermen.
Mr Ho Minh Dung from Ha Noi’s Hoan Kiem District said that he was deeply impressed by the fascinating activities on the island, such as going seine net fishing, collecting rock and 'vu nang' (her breast) snails, and diving to explore the colourful corals and fish.
Hai Van Pass, a challenge for new and experienced bikers
The 24km scenic and zigzagging road of the Hai Van Pass is always a favourite of motorbike adventurers.
The top of Hai Van Pass, which is the frontier between Thua Thien-Hue Province and Da Nang City, still boasts the historic brick Hai Van Gate, built under the Tran dynasty in 1470, when King Tran Nhan Tong proclaimed that Hai Van was ‘the most marvelous wonder'.
The pass, popular for motorbike drivers since the Hai Van Tunnel became operational in 2005, is quiet and safe for off-road bikers and tourists.
But the bends on the road still challenge drivers with a 15 percent uphill slope.
The mountain top is always covered by clouds, and often has a cool temperature of about 17 degrees Celsius.
Drivers can face difficulties due to fog on rainy days and also late in the evening.
Tourists can reach the top of the pass and return to find a rest stop at the base of the mountain in Da Nang.
The Mekong Hai Van rest stop at the base of the mountain is often a stop for trans-Viet Nam travellers, and for camping as well as a rendezvous point for weekend team-building activities.
It's also the first stop just 2km after the Hai Van Tunnel – the longest tunnel in ASEAN, connecting Thua Thien-Hue province and Da Nang city – for people travelling a long distance by bus or motorbikes.
The main two-storey building, with a 200m–diameter conical structure, has souvenir shops and food corners for visitors.
Pham Van Tuan, the manager of the Mekong Hai Van restaurant, said three restaurants with 2,500 seats offered a large and relaxed space for travellers.
Am Phu Cave – a mysterious trip to hell
Da Nang’s Marble Mountains is renowned for its numerous mysterious caves.
Most notably, the Am Phu (Hell) Cave is the longest and most mysterious at this tourist site.
The 302m-long cave is located inside Thuy Son (Water Mountain), which is one of the 5 mountains symbolising the basic elements of ancient oriental philosophy.
The arches of the natural cave range from 45m to 50m, and there are impressive rock formations featuring the Buddhist perception of hell or purgatory.
The cave has 2 sets of stairs - one up to heaven, and the other down to hell.
Buddhist monk Thich Hue Hung was monitoring the restoration of the cave between 2003 and 2006.
In his explanation of the Buddhist philosophy of causality, he said that those who did good deeds in life would be guaranteed a trip to the cave’s 'Thien Thai Gioi' (Paradise) immediately upon their death, whilst anyone committing wrong or evil actions would descend to the 10 circles of hell, and especially to the ‘Nguc A Ty’ (A Ty Jail), which is the cave’s deepest point.
Walking through the impressive stalactites and stalagmites, visitors cannot fail to be impressed by the cave’s Purgatory section, through which sinners’ souls must first pass to be punished.
There is also a court where hell’s judges evaluate a sinner's acts and decide on the level of punishment.
In the middle of the cave is a statue of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva who is often referred to as the Bodhisattva of the Hell beings.
Here, a spiritual scale is used to weigh one’s good and bad deeds.
Most notably, the cave has many man-made sculptures showing threatening scenes of punishment.
The Am Phu Cave features a harmonious combination of folklore and Buddhism's valuable philosophy of humanity.
The scenes of horror mentioned-above intend to educate human beings about doing good deeds in life and to ‘turn over a new leaf’ to stop a bad habit or make a positive change to their characters.
Hoa My Sakyamuni Buddha Statue
The Hoa My Sakyamuni Buddha Statue is situated near the Quang Minh Pagoda in Lien Chieu District’s Hoa Minh Ward, about 7km west of the inner city.
The 20m-high statue sits on a 10m-high lotus-shaped pedestal.
Built in 1965, the statue has 5 floors inside.
The 1st floor, with a diameter of 9.6m, has been used as a Buddhist library for the past 5 years.
On the left-hand side of the 1st floor’s front door, 29 internal steps lead up to the 2nd floor which is an exhibition area for Buddha statues, calligraphic paintings, and pictures of Bodhidharma.
From the 2nd floor, there is a 26-step staircase leading to the 3rd floor which showcases calligraphy and watercolour paintings.
From here, a further 23 steps lead up to the 4th floor and the display of a Buddha Shakyamuni Statue, and another 23 lead visitors to the top floor.
Between the 4th and 5th floors there is a 60cm-diameter circular window from which visitors can enjoy an amazing panoramic view of this part of the city.
Tran Thi Ly Bridge - a striking landmark
Da Nang’s Tran Thi Ly Bridge is the fifth bridge up the Han River, about 1 km south of the Rong (Dragon) Bridge.
The construction of the 1,709 billion VND bridge began in April 2009, and it was officially opened to traffic on 29 March 2013.
With its suspension cables, the bridge forms an upside-down capital “Y” and is intended to look like sails facing towards the East Sea.
The bridge has emerged as a must-see feature of Da Nang and an ideal place for visitors who like taking souvenir photos during their stay in the city.
It is believed that the bridge, with the image of sails filled with wind, not only shows charming and gentle characteristics, but also symbolises the city’s aspirations for further development in the future.
It has one of the most unique architectural styles of all the bridges in Viet Nam.
A striking feature of its design is the 145m-high, backwards-leaning single tower which creates the eye-catching form of the bridge.
The bridge was named after Vietnamese revolutionary activist Tran Thi Ly from Quang Nam Province’s Dien Ban District, whose real name was Tran Thi Nham.
She was a member of the Viet Nam People’s Army and the South Viet Nam Liberation Army.
During the past two resistance wars, even though Miss Ly was brutally and inhumanely tortured in the prisons of the invaders, she showed her indomitable spirit and admirable bravery, and she never revealed any of Viet Nam’s revolutionary strategies and plans to the enemy.
Before the building of the Tran Thi Ly Bridge could begin, an older bridge had to be removed from the same site.
Built by the French over 60 years ago, the De Lattre Bridge was the first bridge to span across the Han River.
In the 1950s, experts from the USA arrived in Da Nang to conduct surveys on the Son Tra Peninsula and the Marble Mountains.
At that time, the French colonisers embarked on turning Da Nang into a military base through the construction of new infrastructure and upgrading the existing.
Amongst the new constructions was the De Lattre Bridge to link the inner-city with the port of Da Nang.
The bridge had the important role of facilitating the transport of aid coming in from the USA to the French in the city.
By 1955, all the local streets whose names were in French had been renamed in Vietnamese, except for Pasteur and Yersin streets which were named after two great benefactors of humanity.
During this period, the De Lattre Bridge was renamed the Trinh Minh The Bridge after a military official under the Republic of Viet Nam during the 1954 - 1975 period.
Con Market - largest wholesale and retail venue in central region
The Con Market at 318 Ong Ich Khiem Street in Da Nang’s Hai Chau District is now the largest wholesale and retail venue in the central region, with over 2,000 traders operating there.
Its reputation entitles the market to first position in the category of local markets on the website of the Da Nang Markets and Fairs Exhibition Management Company at hctl-danang.com.vn.
The market was first established in the 1940s on a hillock at the centre of the city.
At that time, it was a perfect trading venue for the many traders from the city and the rural districts of Dai Loc, Que Son and Thang Binh in Quang Nam Province.
The traders sold their locally-grown agricultural products, mainly fresh vegetables and poultry.
A rebuild of the market started in December 1984.
It took over 3 months to complete the construction, and it was officially inaugurated on 29 March 1985 to mark the 10th anniversary of the city’s liberation.
The new market incorporated a 3,480 m2 3-storey building, two 1,562 m2 2-storey buildings, and a block of single-storey houses with a total area of 8,828 m2, along with a number of other auxiliary facilities.
There were 1,473 traders in the market, and many local cooperatives, private businesses and limited companies became involved in trading activities there.
Various types of goods were sold at the venue to satisfy the increasing shopping demands of the local residents, and tens of thousands of customers were welcomed every day.
The market was at one time renamed Da Nang Commercial Centre.
The current Con Market is now not only a shopping venue in the inner city, but a must-see destination for tourists visiting the beautiful seaside city.
The market sells whatever you want to buy.
Da Den - a hidden gem for outdoor activities
Da Den (Black Rock) is a beautiful spot on the northern side of Da Nang’s Son Tra Peninsula, and it can be reached by tourist boat from the Han River.
It is an ideal place for outdoor activities with relatives and friends.
As its name suggests, Da Den features many large black rocks heaped together, which creates beautiful viewing angles.
In the nearby waters there is a wide variety of marine creatures such as red snapper, goby, grouper, littorina littorea, scallop, and “vu nang” (her breast) snail which was thought to be only found on the Cu Lao Cham Island off Hoi An.
Visitors to Da Den can take the opportunity to go fishing with local fishermen or dive to explore the coral reefs.
Apart from a fine beach for sunbathing and swimming, it is also a perfect place for building a campfire or for organising interesting teambuilding activities.
In order to provide easier access for visitors, a pier for the tourist boats is planned to be built here soon.
In addition, local travel agents are planning to launch more tours to attract more visitors, both domestic and foreign.
Wax Museum gaining in popularity
Located at Da Nang’s Ba Na Hills Resort, the first-ever Wax Museum in Viet Nam has become very popular with local residents, and domestic and foreign visitors.
The museum, created in an ancient French architectural style, has 10 different display areas which feature about 50 wax replicas of world-renowned politicians, athletes and movie stars.
They include the US President Barack Obama, the Russian President Vladimir Putin, the former South African President Nelson Mandela, the late martial artist Bruce Lee, the Chinese martial artist Jet Li, soccer stars David Beckham and Lionel Messi, movie stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and the late singer Michael Jackson.
The real-size replicas are made of a mixture of beeswax and plastic.
Visitors to the museum will have an opportunity to take photos of the wax figures of their idols, and learn about how waxworks are made, at a factory in the museum.
In addition, there is an area for visitors to make their own waxworks.
After 10 months of operation, the museum now welcomes an estimated 1,000 people per day.
The admission fee is 50,000 VND per person.
But Beach – wonderfully relaxing
But (Buddha) Beach is a beautiful spot on the Son Tra Peninsula, and a must-see place for lovers of ecology.
According to legend, in the time of Emperor Minh Mang, local fishermen discovered a statue of the Goddess of Mercy on the beach, and a temple dedicated to the goddess was built on the site.
Since then, local residents have enjoyed peaceful and prosperous lives, and the area is known as But (Buddha) Beach.
Just about 20 minutes from the city centre, But Beach has become a popular destination for both domestic and foreign visitors over recent years because its natural environment is a perfect example of the harmony between mountains and sea.
Besides being a fine beach for sunbathing and swimming, it is a perfect place for diving to discover the amazing and colourful underwater world of corals and other marine creatures.
In addition, the beach is home to numerous rare plants and animals which are listed in the national Red Book.
Visitors to the beach will also have the opportunity to enjoy a wide range of delicious food and drinks, focusing on local specialities which are served at reasonable prices.
Additionally, there are several water sports and fun beach activities here, such as sailing, surfing and jet-skiing.
In an effort to make But Beach an ideal holiday destination in Da Nang, the construction of the But Beach Bay Complex Resort, one of the city’s large-scale tourism projects, began on 30 April 2004.
The 19 million USD project will cover 199,786m2 of land and 100,500m2 of water, and will become one of the leading luxury resorts in the central region.
The property will feature luxury villas, conference and service centres, a 5-star hotel, and other facilities.
Its design is a perfect combination of modern-style architecture and the cultural characteristics of the coastal central region.
The 1st stage of the project will comprise about 140 luxury garden villas and over 100 bungalows.
The classic-style villas and bungalows are nestled in the hillsides, surrounded by trees of varying shades of green.
Although the project is under construction, many foreigners are showing a keen interest in buying these wonderful villas.
A 5-star 17-storey hotel will be built on an area of 34,432m2 in the project’s 2nd phase.
It will offer wonderful stays with a nice panoramic overview of Da Nang and beautiful sunny beaches for its guests.
In addition, the hotel will provide unforgettable experiences and opportunities to enjoy great sunrise and sunset moments.
Most notably, the Family Hotel, the first of its kind in the But Beach Complex, will be situated at the centre of the project.
This hotel will be a good choice for guests wanting value for money with unlimited numbers of people allowed to stay in one room and use all the hotel’s services.
For the 3rd stage of the project, a square will be built on the But Beach and it will become an attractive shopping area and an excellent avenue to host traditional cultural festivals, and international fairs and exhibitions.
In addition, there will be an exhibition area to display the city’s artworks, and to introduce its history and development to visitors.
The most impressive feature of the resort will be a special area for water, sound and light shows.
Guests will be treated to exciting and thrilling performances.
It is expected that the But Beach Bay Complex Resort in particular, and the But Beach Tourist Area in general, will emerge as Da Nang’s most attractive and romantic destination for travellers from home and abroad.
The beach will be the best place to get close to the natural world, and a truly peaceful place to relax.
Tho Quang fishing village
Just about 8km northeast of Da Nang’s centre, the Tho Quang fishing village in Son Tra District is proud of the solidarity among its local residents.
In addition, villagers are honest and live in harmony with nature.
They all feel very happy when they bring home bumper catches.
All of the village’s men go offshore fishing and their wives help their husbands to take their seafood catches to markets for sale.
The villagers depend directly on fishing activities for their livelihood.
Like other craft villages in Viet Nam, the skilled local villagers make their own fishing tackle to help them to catch more fish.
In spite of all the difficulties and challenges in their lives, the villagers show solidarity and support for each other.
The local fishermen help each other while fishing at sea in situations of bad weather or other dangers.
Although they have a habit of talking loudly, they are hard-working, gentle, honest, friendly, kind and helpful people.
Fishing is a dangerous job and fishermen often work under extreme conditions at sea.
Therefore, various events are held every year in the village to show the local fishermen’s strong desire for safe offshore fishing trips, with bumper catches.
These include the whale worship cult, and the annual “Cau Ngu” festival.
The events feature a number of solemn traditional rituals to pray for happiness and prosperity throughout the year, as well as for a safe and profitable fishing season.
Apart from being involved in fishing activities, the Tho Quang fishing village is also well-known for its fish sauce-making.
It is very famous for many types of mam (salted fish) such as mam nem (a type of fish sauce, made from small fish or small shrimps) and mam ruoc (fermented shrimp paste).
In particular, the village’s mam ruoc is very popular with the city’s people.
The mam products are an indispensable dipping sauce with the daily meals of residents in the central region.
Cam Le kho me cake village
Cam Le village is situated in Cam Le District’s Khue Trung Ward, and is well-known for its kho me (sesame) cake making.
Visitors to this village will fall in love with the scenic beauty and peaceful atmosphere of the landscape here.
Kho me cake is a speciality of Quang Nam Province and Da Nang, and Cam Le village has the best reputation in Viet Nam.
The village is home to 6 cake production establishments which create job opportunities for over 50 local people.
Amongst local cake producers, the brand name ‘Mrs Lieu’ is very famous in both domestic and foreign markets.
This brand name is owned by Huynh Thi Dieu whose production facility is located on the northern side of the Cam Le Bridge.
Kho me cakes are made from glutinous flour, rice flour, granulated sugar, ginger, and sesame seeds.
The rice flour is mixed with the glutinous flour, then poured into a mould to be steamed and then dried.
Next, the cakes are coated in sugar or sesame.
The ones that are coated in sugar are called “kho no”, whilst those coated in sesame are called “kho me”.
The delicious cakes are soft with well-dried sesame, and when they are broken the sugar must be like thin yellow silk cords.
Local families usually put these cakes on their altars on the death anniversaries of their relatives or at Tet.
Cam Le banh kho me has made it into the list of the top 10 most well-known Vietnamese gift specialities.
Visitors to this village can buy these cakes and give them as gifts to their relatives and friends.
This is one of the local specialties which many visitors are interested in.
Today, kho me cakes are sold across the whole country, as well as abroad.
Tuy Loan rice paper village
About 15km southwest of Da Nang, the Tuy Loan ancient village is located in Hoa Vang District’s Hoa Phong Commune.
It boasts beautiful scenery and the unique characteristics of a typical Vietnamese rural village.
Despite its many ups and downs over the past 5 centuries, local residents are proud of the village's many old houses, its history, its beautiful setting and its many interesting features which include an old banyan tree, a boat station, and a communal house.
Villagers also take pride in their My Quang (Quang rice noodles) speciality and their rice paper making.
Soft rice paper is one of the most popular foods at Tet.
Although there are many different types of rice paper, Tuy Loan’s is the most famous because of its unique method of production and its amazing flavours of garlic and ginger.
It has become very popular with local residents and both domestic and overseas visitors.
In order to make the tasty rice paper, deliciously scented rice from the winter-spring crop is used.
Tuy Loan’s rice paper tastes very different from similar products produced elsewhere thanks to its special recipe which includes various spice mixes such as dipping sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and sesame.
Also unlike elsewhere in the country, Tuy Loan’s villagers dry their products on charcoal fires instead of drying them in the sun, which prevents any mould formation.
If you visit this village, you will have an unforgettable experience enjoying delicious My Quang accompanied by Tuy Loan’s rice paper.
Nam O fish sauce village
Nestled on Hoa Hiep Ward, Lien Chieu District, the Nam O village is well-known for its fish sauce-making.
Its product wins the trust of customers both at home and abroad.
Established in the early 20th century, Nam O is a small fishing village which is regarded as one of the best producers of this delicious dipping sauce.
The Nam O village used to support itself by producing firecrackers until the government imposed a ban on them in 1995.
The Nam O brand of fish sauce tastes very different from similar products from elsewhere in the country thanks to its special recipe.
An Association of the Nam O Fish Sauce Village has been established and is recognised by the National Office of Intellectual Property of Viet Nam.
In addition, the Association has been granted a collective label for its fish sauce product.
Nam O fish sauce is made from long-jawed anchovies with a high protein content which are caught in the 3rd lunar month.
Its delicious taste is partly attributed to the fish mixed with salt which is sourced from Ca Na Beach in Ninh Thuan Province.
The grains of this salt are white, well-dried, and larger than the salt from other localities.
It is dried on a cement floor for between five and seven days, and it is then stored in pottery vats for a few of years before being used to salt the fish.
The process of salting the fish starts from the 3rd lunar month and the sauce-making will be finished in the days leading up to the next Tet Festival.
Nam O fish sauce is dark red and has a very nice aroma.
The fish must be freshly caught and of medium size.
They are cleaned in sea water before being preserved, not fresh water because this takes away their taste and smell and the fish can go off easily during the long preservation period.
The vats must be made from special woods, including jackfruit wood.
The fish is mixed with salt and layered in the jars.
Over the top layer is placed a grid of bamboo or dried areca bark.
The vat is carefully sealed and kept in a dark, dry, clean and cool place away from the wind.
After six or seven months, the fish is stirred.
When a white yeast substance forms on the top, the grid is taken off.
At the beginning of the lunar new year, the preserved mixture is filtered through a piece of silk to create the dark red fish sauce.
Despite its many ups and downs over the past 2 centuries, fish sauce-making in this village still flourishes today due to its special secret recipe. At Tet or on other special occasions, many people in the city and from localities beyond seek to buy bottles of Nam O fish sauce because of its special flavour.
Cam Ne sedge mat-making village
Located in Hoa Tien Commune, Hoa Vang District, just about 14km south-west of Da Nang's centre, the Cam Ne Village is widely known for its long-standing sedge mat-making craft.
These beautifully-coloured mats are used for sleeping on.
Senior villagers said that the craft originated in Thanh Hoa Province’s Hoang Hoa District and it was introduced to Da Nang in the 15th century by immigrants from this Thanh Hoa.
After that, Cam Ne’s craft developed strongly and became well-known under the Nguyen Dynasty.
The mats were used by the Nguyen royal family and many artisans from the village were honoured by the Nguyen emperors.
Despite its many ups and downs over the past 6 centuries, sedge mat-making in this village is still flourishing today.
Mat makers require skilful hands and an artist's eye to create these beautiful and quality products.
Sedges are cleaned, dyed in various colours, and then dried under the sun.
Then they are soaked in water to become soft before they are used to make the mats.
Once produced, the mats are cleaned and made smooth before sale.
Cam Ne sedge mats are more durable and thicker than similar products from other localities, and users will feel cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
A pair of mats 1.6m wide x 2m long sells for 500,000VND.
Nam O Beach – a wonderful gift of nature
Nestled in Hoa Hiep Nam Ward, Lien Chieu District, just about 17km north-west of Da Nang’s centre, Nam O Beach boasts stunning scenery and it is truly nature’s wonderful gift.
This beach is best viewed at low tide when a large area of rock and sandy shoreline is exposed.
It shelters a large population of rare fish and other marine species, and has a moderate slope with clear blue water and white sand stretching along the foot of a mountain.
From here, visitors can reach the Son Tra peninsula by road along the mountain or by boat to the west coast, or visit a village of the Co Tu ethnic group in Hoa Vang District’s Hoa Bac Commune.
According to locals, the name “Nam O” means the south of O District (a very old location).
The Nam O village used to support itself by producing firecrackers until the government imposed a ban on them in 1995.
Nowadays, the villagers make nuoc mam (fish sauce) and goi ca.
The latter is a kind of Vietnamese sushi: fresh, raw fish fillets marinated in a special sauce and coated in a spicy powder.

Qua Giang Communal House
The Qua Giang Communal House is situated in Qua Giang Village, Hoa Phuoc Commune, Hoa Vang District, Da Nang.
It was built in 1821 and it is an interesting place for those who want to learn more about the history and culture of a Vietnamese ancient village.
The site is home to the holy temple of Quan Thanh De Quan, the saint who has been praised for his resplendent symbol of morality, loyalty, faith, frankness and righteousness.
In addition, it is dedicated to the founding members of Qua Giang Village’s 4 clans, named Dinh, Le, Tran and Nguyen.
In the reign of Lord Nguyen, these clans from the northern region together founded Qua Giang Village which originally consisted of Qua Giang, Giang Nam, Tra Kiem, An Luu and Con Mong areas.
The house is a great example of the architectural style of the Nguyen dynasty, with its pantile roofs and brick walls.
It features 2 parts - the front house and the main temple terrace, and 2 covered corridors connect these parts to form a rectangular-shaped structure.
The front house has 8 main wood pillars, each measuring 5m in height.
The rafters are patterned after "Chong ruong - Gia thu" and are carved with stylised floral and animal designs.
The main temple terrace has three sections with four roofs.
The pillars against the walls are carved with dragon’s heads, the word “longevity” written in Chinese script, and floral designs.
The doors were made by skilful carpenters from Kim Bong Village in Hoi An.
The temple’s roof is decorated with two dragons turning their heads and looking at each other, a well-matched pair of phoenixes, unicorns and tortoises.
According to Vietnamese beliefs, these are the 4 sacred animals which symbolise power, intellect, longevity and nobility.
They are all encrusted with shards of pottery.
The communal house was recognised as a historical and cultural relic on 1 February 2000 by the Ministry of Culture and Information.
To commemorate the village’s founders, ceremonies are held annually at the communal house on the 20th day of the 2nd lunar month, and the 12th day of the 7th lunar month.

Countryside Market
Many communes in rural Viet Nam feature countryside markets (cho que).
There are two main types of countryside market: the fair and the evening market.
Fairs are held periodically.
For example, it may be held on days with the numbers three and eight, which would imply fairs on the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th days of each lunar month.
Major markets attract huge numbers of people.
Apart from local products, visitors can find industrial and expensive commodities produced in other localities.
Of course, necessities such as fruit, oil, salt and vegetables are always available.
Highland Market
Markets in highland areas where ethnic minorities reside are not only places of commerce, but also cultural festivals.
People wear their nicest clothes and spend some days at the market.
They may play their pan-flutes, dance, sing and meet new friends.
Therefore, markets in highland areas are also called Love Markets (Cho Tinh).
Floating Markets
There is a very interesting kind of market in the Mekong River Delta.
Thousands of boats gather to form a place of economic activity.
Trading activities take place all day, but the most exciting time is in the morning when boats arrive loaded up with agricultural products.
On a cho noi (floating market) all trade activities take place on boats.
The largest cho noi include Phung Hiep, Nga Bay, Phong Dien (in Hau Giang), Cai Rang (in Can Tho) and Cai Be (in Tien Giang).
Most of the agricultural productions sold in cho noi are for wholesalers, who then re-sell it to food processing factories or ship it to the north.
HA LONG BAY (WORLD NATURAL HERITAGE)
Geographical position: Situated in the north-east region of Viet Nam, Ha Long Bay is a part of Bac Bo Gulf and comprises the sea area of Ha Long City, Cam Pha City and a part of Van Don island district, Quang Ninh Province.
It borders Cat Ba Island to the south-west, the mainland to the west with a 120km-long coastline. Ha Long Bay covers a total area of 1,553km², including 1,969 islands of various sizes, 989 of which have been given names.
The average geological age of the islands is between 250 and 280 million years old.
Ha Long Bay has been called by the great national poet Nguyen Trai: "a marvel of the earth erected towards the high skies".
There are many names given to islands according to their shapes and forms such as Hon Dau Nguoi (Human Head Islet), Hon Rong (Dragon Islet), Hon Canh Buom (Sail Islet), Hon Trong Mai (Cock and Hen Islet)…
But the beauty of Halong Bay does not consist only in the forms of its mountains, islands and the colour of its waters, but also in its infinitely rich system of grottoes and caves such as: Thien Cung (Heavenly Palace Grotto), Dau Go (Driftwood Grotto), Sung Sot (Surprise Grotto), Tam Cung (Three Palace Grotto), Trinh Nu (Virgin Grotto)...
Each is a grandiose and refined natural architectural creation.

PHONG NHA - KE BANG NATIONAL PARK (WORLD NATURAL HERITAGE)
Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park lies in Quang Binh Province - the central Viet Nam.
Covering an area of more than 343,000 hectares (heart zone of 123,300ha and buffer zone of 220,000ha), Phong Nha – Ke Bang situated in Quang Ninh, Bo Trach and Minh Hoa districts, is 50km northwest of Dong Hoi City.
Phong Nha - Ke Bang can be compared to a huge geological museum thanks to its complicated geological structure with different categories of stone including sandstone, quartz, schist, siliceous limestone, granite, granodiorite, diorite, applet, pegmatite, etc.
Phong Nha-Ke Bang is the oldest and largest tropical karst formed 400 million years during the main geological periods of the Earth, bearing the original topographic and geologic characteristics.
Experiencing major tectonic phases, high mountain ranges and the depressed sedimentary basins were formed.
These fluctuations have also contributed to the diversity of geology, topography, geomorphology.
Phong Nha - Ke Bang karst mountains can provide a lot of valuable information about the Earth's prolonged geological process through various periods, from the Ordovician Age - Silurian Age (about 463.9 - 430 million year ago) to the Quaternary Age (1.75 million years ago).
It is also noteworthy to mention a geological characteristic – the system of underground rivers and grottos in limestone mountains.
In the non-karst geomorphologic area, there are many low mountains covered by a floristic carpet.
The erosion has created a number of abrasion-accumulation terraces along the valleys of the Son and Chay rivers and at the margins of the central limestone massifs.
The transition terrain consists of a diversity of rock intercalated by limestone mountains.
Locating in the area with a high average rainfall, however, few rivers and streams can be seen because water is absorbed to run inside limestone mountains. Therefore over tens of million years, water has eroded rocks, creating numerous caves in the area.
Phong Nha - Ke Bang area is noted for its cave and grotto systems as it is composed of 300 caves and grottos, divided into three main systems: Phong Nha Grottos, Vom Caves, and Ruc Mon Caves.
The Phong Nha grotto system is about 80km long in total, rising from south of Ke Bang Limestone Mountain.
The main entrances are Khe Ry and En Grottoes situated at a height of 300m above sea level.
The grottoes of this tree-branch system run in the direction of northeast-southwest.
The system of Vom caves is over 35km long, rising from Ruc Ca Roong Cave located at a height of 360m above sea level and ending with Vom Cave.
The system runs south and north.
Ruc Ca Roong River sometimes hides in mountains, sometimes appears in narrow and deep valleys, and flows into the Chay River at the entrance of Vom Cave.
The system of Ruc Mon caves that lies in the district of Minh Hoa is also a large cave. However, the information about this system is not abundant because few surveys have been conducted in this area so far.
Some typical caves and grottoes in Phong Nha - Ke Bang are Phong Nha, Tien Son and Thien Duong grottoes, Toi, En and Khe Ry caves. Especially, Son Doong Cave is considered as the largest cave in the world with 200m in height, 200m in width, at least 8.5km in length.
With its characteristics of topography, climate, soil and hydrography, Phong Nha - Ke Bang boasts a rich, diversified and unique flora.
Investigations show that Phong Nha - Ke Bang has a large tropical forest floor. It covers 93.57 percent of the natural area, of which nearly 83.74 percent is covered by primeval forests.
The diversity of rare and precious species of animals and plants in Phong Nha - Ke Bang is corollary of its natural conditions, and is a feature of the forest ecosystem.
Statistics show that the flora of Phong Nha - Ke Bang belongs to 2,400 species of higher plants with 208 orchid species, of which many rare and precious species are listed in Viet Nam’s Red Book and IUCN’s Red Book (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources).
Besides, there are 140 animal species, 356 bird species, 97 reptile species, 47 amphibian species, 162 fish species, 369 insect species, many of which are listed in Red Book of Viet Nam and IUCN such as Sao la, Mang lon, Mang Truong Son, Ha Tinh langur… Phong Nha - Ke Bang is considered a huge biological museum in Viet Nam.
Phong Nha – Ke Bang has been declared a world natural heritage by UNESCO twice in July 2003 in the 27th meeting in Paris (France) and July 2015 in the 39th meeting in Bonn (Federal Republic of Germany).

COMPLEX OF HUE MONUMENTS (WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE)
Location
Complex of Hue Monuments lies along the Perfume River in Hue City and some adjacent areas of Thua Thien Hue Province.
Hue City constitutes the cultural, political and economic centre of the province, and was the old imperial city of Viet Nam under the Nguyen Dynasty from 1802 to 1945.
History
Since 1306, after the wedding of the princess Huyen Tran of the Tran Dynasty with Che Man, the Cham King, the territories of Chau O and Chau Ly (comprised of Quang Tri, Thua Thien - Hue and part of Northern Quang Nam today) took the name of Thuan Hoa.
In the second half of the 15th century, under the reign of King Le Thanh Tong, the name of "Hue" appeared for the first time.
In 1636, the residence of the Nguyen Lords was settled at Kim Long (Hue). In 1687, it was transferred to Phu Xuan – where is the Citadel today.
Early in the 18th century, Phu Xuan became the political, economic and cultural centre of the southern part of Viet Nam.
Then, from 1788 to 1801, it became the capital of the Tay Son Dynasty.
From 1802 to 1945, Hue was the capital of unified Viet Nam under the reign of the 13 Nguyen Kings.
During these years, architectural works of a high cultural and historic value were built: the Citadel, especially the Imperial City (including 253 constructions), 7 Royal tomb compound of 9 kings of the Nguyen Dynasty, the Esplanade of Nam Giao, the Ho Quyen arena and the Hon Chen Temple.
Cultural values
Located in the centre of Hue, along the Perfume (Huong) River’s northern bank, the complex of royal architecture represents and demonstrates the power of the Nguyen Dynasty's centralism. Contained in this complex are the Hue Capital Citadel, the Royal Citadel or Imperial City and the Forbidden Citadel clustered together, symmetrically placed along the longitudinal axis and facing to the south.
The system of walls combines sophisticatedly both eastern and western architectural styles placed in natural harmony with Ngu Binh Mount, Perfume River, Gia Vien and Boc Thanh islets. Even people implicitly consider these natural landscapes as a part of the complex.
Surrounded by a square wall, almost 600 metres in length on each side, the Imperial City has four gates, of which the south gate (Ngo Mon) is most typical in construction and is widely seen and recognized as the symbol of Hue Citadel. It served not only as the main entrance but was also the place where important events of the dynasty took place.
Within the area of the Imperial City, the Forbidden Citadel was the area reserved for daily activities of the royal family.
The main north-south axis, called miraculous road, runs through the three walls of the Hue Capital Citadel, Imperial City and Forbidden Citadel and was marked with the important constructions of Hue Citadel. Hundred of small and large buildings were built symmetrically along this axis in harmony with their natural surroundings gives one a feeling of gentle and serenity. These buildings include Nghinh Luong Pavilion (Pavilion for Fresh Air), Phu Van Lau (or the Pavilion of Edicts was the building where Emperor's edicts and lists of successful candidates of Thi Hoi (National Examination) and Thi Dinh (Court Examinations) were publicised), Ky Dai (Flag Tower), Ngo Mon Gate (the main entrance), Thai Hoa Palace (The Throne Palace, or Palace of the Supreme Harmony, was the building for great court's meetings), Can Chanh Palace (the place for every day working of Emperors), Can Thanh Palace (Emperor's Private Palace), Khon Thai Residence (Queen's Private Apartment), Kien Trung Pavilion (the place for daily activities of Emperors)...
In the distance, to the west of the Capital Citadel, along the Perfume River, are the famous royal tombs and temples, masterpieces in landscape architecture built by the Nguyen Dynasty.
This resulted in the architecture of royal tombs in Hue being distinguished by unique characteristics.
Each tomb reflects its owner’s life and character: the magnificence of Gia Long’s tomb in the immense landscape of mountains and jungles represents the spirit of a general in war; the symmetry and majesty of Minh Mang’s tomb combiners both man-made and natural mountains and lakes and reveals the powerful will and solemn nature of a talented politician who was also an orderly poet; the peaceful and sombre qualities of Thieu Tri’s tomb reflects the innermost feelings of an outstanding poet who made few achievements in political life; the romance and poetic atmosphere of Tu Duc’s tomb evoke the elegant and subtle tendency of a poet rather than the strong characteristic of a politician.
In addition, place-names that embellish for the beauty of the Complex of Hue Monuments can be named as: Huong River, Ngu Binh Mountain, Thien Mu Pagoda, Bach Ma Mountain, the Thuan An and Lang Co Beaches...
At the meeting of the 17th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) in Columbia, from the 6th to the 11th of December 1993, UNESCO has come to the decision of recognising the architectural ensemble of Hue as a world cultural heritage.
This was a noteworthy event in the cultural history. For the reason that Hue is the first site in Vietnam ever listed in the World Heritage list.
As to the cultural value, a World Cultural Heritage Site, like the Complex of Hue Monuments, has to:
- Be representative of an original artistic achievement, a masterpiece created by Man’s hands;
- Have a great value for its building technique or its architecture in a general development plan for a city or in a program for the embellishment of the sight of a world cultural zone;

The architecture of Hoi An is characterised by a harmonious blend of Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese influences.
After many centuries, Hoi An is still respectful of its traditions, folk festivals, beliefs and of its sophisticated culinary art.

For centuries, Hoi An had developed into a melting pot of various nationalities who came to the area, bringing along their own cultures.
Accordingly, Hoi An features the co-existence of indigenous customs and habits and those imported by foreign settlers.

MY SON SANCTUARY (WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE)
My Son Sanctuary is set in a small valley belonging to Duy Phu Commune, Duy Xuyen District, Quang Nam Province, about 70km southwest of Danang City and 40km from Hoi An City.
At the beginning of the 7th century, King Sambhuvarman had it rebuilt and rebaptized Sambhu-Bhadresvara.
Each new monarch came to My Son after his accession to the throne, for the ceremony of purification and to present offerings and erect new monuments, which explains why My Son is the only place where Cham art flourished without interruption from the 7th to the 13th century.
The temples in My Son were built into groups that basically followed the same model.
Each group was comprised of a main sanctuary (kalan), surrounded by towers and auxiliary monuments.
The kalan, which is a symbol of Meru Mountain (centre of the universe, where the gods live) is dedicated to Shiva.
The small temples are devoted to the spirits of the eight compass points.
In the towers, topped with tiled, curved roofs, were stocked the offerings and sacred objects of the pilgrims.
Cham temples do not have windows, so they are very dark inside. Windows are only found on the towers.
Cham towers and temples are built of bricks associated with sandstone decorations.
It is quite noteworthy that no adhesive can be seen in between the bricks, which is amazing since some of the works have survived thousands of years.
The structures were built, and only then did the sculptors carve the decorations of floral patterns, human figures or animals.
This technique is unique in Asia.
Every kalan in My Son is comprised of three parts: the bhurloka (foundations), the bhurvaloka (body of the tower) and the svarloka (roof).
The bhurloka represents the terrestrial world.
It is decorated all the way round by engravings of patterns, animals, human characters praying under small vaults, masks of Kala or Makara (monsters), dancers, musicians…
The bhurvaloka symbolises the spiritual world where, after being purified, men could meet the ancestors and the gods.
The svarloka usually has three storeys in the same style as the base, and features a main door and other, false, ones.
It is decorated with small sandstone or brick statues representing mythical animals, which are mounts ridden by gods in the Indian tradition: birds, swans, buffaloes, elephants or lions.
There are small decorative towers at the corners of the 1st and 2nd storeys.
Thanks to Henri Parmentier, the temples of My Son were classified into groups of letters (A, A’, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and K), and then numbered according to their functions.
It starts with the main sanctuary, the kalan, (number 1), then the gate tower (number 2), and so on.
Even though these categories break up the architectural complex of My Son as a whole, they are remarkably efficient for the study and maintenance of the ruins.
In December, 1999, at the 23th meeting of World Heritage Committee of UNESCO in Marrakesh, Marocco, My Son was recognised as world cultural heritage based on two prominent criteria: criterion (ii) an exceptional example of cultural interchange, with an indigenous society adapting to external cultural influences, notably the Hindu art and architecture of the Indian sub-continent and criterion (iii) the Champa Kingdom was an important phenomenon in the political and cultural history of South – East Asia, vividly illustrated by the ruins of My Son.

CENTRAL SECTOR OF THE IMPERIAL CITADEL OF THANG LONG - HA NOI (WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE)
Geographical position
The central sector of Imperial Citadel of Thang Long – Ha Noi covers area of 18.395ha, includes archaeological area at 18 Hoang Dieu Street and relics in Ha Noi Citadel such as: Ha Noi Flag Tower, Doan Mon, Kinh Thien Palace, Building D67, Hau Lau, Bac Mon, Forbidden City wall and eight gates from the Nguyen Dynasty.
These relics are located in Ba Dinh District and surrounded by Phan Dinh Phung Street in the north; Bac Son Street and National Assembly Building in the south; Hoang Dieu, Doc Lap streets and National Building in the west; Dien Bien Phu Street in the southwest and Nguyen Tri Phuong Street in the east.
History
In 1009, Ly Cong Uan was enthroned, founded Ly Dynasty.
In July, 1010, the king promulgated Chieu Doi Do (the royal decree) to change the capital city from Hoa Lu (Ninh Binh) to Dai La Citadel.
After transferring the capital city, Ly Cong Uan had Citadel of Thang Long built and the citadel construction was finished in early 1011.
The ancient Citadel of Thang Long was encircled by three incorporated forts. The outer fort was Kinh Thanh (Imperial City), where the general public lived. Surrounded by the Hong, To Lich and Kim Nguu rivers, Kinh Thanh acted as a dyke system for the capital city.
The second fort (the middle ring) was Hoang Thanh (Imperial Citadel), where the royal court, offices and residence of mandarins were located.
The smallest and most inner enclosure was Tu Cam Thanh (Forbidden City) where the king, queens and concubines lived in seclusion.
The Citadel of Thang Long was repaired and had many new works in Tran Dynasty and expanded in Le So Dynasty.
From 1516 to 1788 in dynasties of Mac and Le Trung Hung, the Citadel of Thang Long was destroyed many times.
In early 1789, King Quang Trung transferred the capital city to Phu Xuan, the Citadel of Thang Long only acted as Bac Thanh (the northern defensive fortification).
In Nguyen Dynasty, the remainders of the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long were transferred to Phu Xuan for building new citadel.
Only Kinh Thien Palace and Hau Lau were retained to be accommodations for Kings Nguyen during their business trips to the Bac Thanh.
In 1805, King Gia Long ordered the demolition of walls surrounding the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long and requested the building of a new, smaller citadel called Ha Noi Citadel with architectural style of Vauban (France).
In 1831, King Minh Mang changed name of the Citadel of Thang Long to Ha Noi Province in a big administrative reform.
When French colonists occupied all Indochina, they chose Ha Noi as the capital of French Indochina Union and the Ha Noi Citadel was destroyed to build military camp for French colonists.
Since the Vietnamese army took the control of the capital city in 1954, the Ha Noi Citadel has become the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense.
The first value of the central sector of Imperial Citadel of Thang Long – Ha Noi shows that it is nearly a book displaying over 10 century- history of Thang Long – Ha Noi from Dai La Citadel in Pre-Thang Long period to nowadays.
Archaeological value
History revealed that Imperial Citadel of Thang Long changed a lot but its centre, especially Forbidden City, remained nearly unchanged.
As architectural structures inside the Imperial Citadel were rebuilt and upgraded several times, this explained for the findings of layers of architectural vestiges and artefacts at archaeological site at 18 Hoang Dieu.
These vestiges reflect clearly relation between urban project and architectural space as well as succession of dynasties in building the Citadel of Thang Long.
This is the unique and prominent value of the central sector of Imperial Citadel of Thang Long – Ha Noi.
Here, archaeologists excavated a great deal of porcelain and ceramic wares used in the Imperial Citadel through various stages of development.
The findings paved the way for researchers to study ceramics made in Thang Long and ceramic wares used in the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long through different dynasties. It is also concrete evidence about high development level of economy and culture.
In addition, porcelains and bronze coins of China, Japan, Western Asia… found here proved that Thang Long was centre of cultural exchange among countries in area and received quintessence values of humanity.
At 20h30 on July 30, 2010 in Brasilia Capital of Brazil, World Heritage Committee of UNESCO recognized the central sector of Imperial Citadel of Thang Long – Ha Noi as world cultural heritage based on three prominent criteria: historical and cultural length; its continuousness as a power centre; diversification and plenty of vestiges and artifacts.
In opening ceremony of the 1000th anniversary of Thang Long – Ha Noi on October 1, 2010, Ms Irina Bokova – General Director of UNESCO gave certification of the central sector of Imperial Citadel of Thang Long – Ha Noi to leaders of Ha Noi City.

CITADEL OF THE HO DYNASTY (WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE)
The citadel of the Ho Dynasty is situated in communes of Vinh Tien, Vinh Long, Vinh Quang, Vinh Yen, Vinh Phuc, Vinh Ninh, Vinh Khang, Vinh Thanh and Vinh Loc Town (Vinh Loc District), Thanh Hoa Province.
It was the capital of Viet Nam from 1398 to 1407.
The citadel of the Ho Dynasty was built in 1397 by Ho Quy Ly who was the highest-ranking mandarin of the Tran Dynasty at the time.
After the citadel was completed, Ho Quy Ly forced King Tran Thuan Tong to move the capital from the citadel of Thang Long (Ha Noi) to Thanh Hoa.
In the second month of the year of Dragon (1400), after coming to the crown to replace the King Tran, Ho Quy Ly renamed the country Dai Ngu (1400-1407), the citadel of the Ho Dynasty officially became the capital citadel.
The citadel of the Ho Dynasty is also known as names of An Ton, Tay Do, Tay Kinh, Tay Nhai,Tay Giai.
The citadel of the Ho Dynasty is considered as the only stone citadel remaining in Southeast Asia and is one of the few remains in the world.
The citadel of the Ho Dynasty has met the two criteria specified in the World Heritage Convention.
It is the criterion (ii), "to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design," and the criterion (iv), "to be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history."
In the world heritage record, the citadel of the Ho Dynasty is briefly described as follows: The citadel of the Ho Dynasty, built according to the feng shui principles, testifies to the flowering of neo-Confucianism in late 14th century in Viet Nam and its spread to other parts of East Asia.
Thanks to the unique construction techniques all the major stone sections are intact and have not been affected by time and weather or by recent urban encroachment.
According to historical documents, ancient bibliographies and archaeological research, the complex of the citadel of the Ho Dynasty includes Thanh Noi (Inner Citadel and also known as Imperial Citadel) with the remains of the royal palaces and temples inside; Hao Thanh; La Thanh and Nam Giao Altar (for worshipping the Heaven).
The Thanh Noi is a unique architectural work, with a circumference of 3,508, an area of 142.2ha; the wall is 870.5m long from north to south; 883.5m long from east to west.
The Thanh Noi has four main gates made of green square stone plates beautifully carved and overlapped tightly one after another.
On the average, each stone plate is 1.5m long, 1m thick and weighs about 15-20 tonnes.
Its four domed gates are called the Southern, Northern, Western and Eastern gates (or also known as the Front, Back, Left and Right gates).
The stone plates on the dome are carved as sections of a grapefruit, tightly overlapping.
The Front gate in the south is the main gate and has three doors. The middle door is 5.82m wide and 5.75m high. The side doors are 5.45m wide and 5.35m high.
Each of three remaining gates has only one door, of which the Northern Gate is 5.8m wide; the Eastern Gate is 5.9m wide; 5.4m high; and the Western Gate is 5.8m wide, 5.4m high.
The wall of the citadel is 5-6m high on average. The highest wall section is the front gate with the height of 10m.
Scientists estimated that the entire wall was made of 25,000m³ of stones.
According to the documents, there were palaces in the Thanh Noi such as Hoang Nguyen, Nhan Tho, Phu Cuc, Dong Cung, Dong Thai Mieu, Tay Thai Mieu, Diem Canh…
However, now the Thanh Noi remains some relics such as a part of the citadel’s wall and four gates, vestiges of lakes, a couple of stone dragons with sophisticated carving features, foundation of Thanh Noi architecture, Hoa Nhai marble-paved road, stone balls, stone bullets, pottery, the Southern gate precinct and valuable objects with specific characteristics of Tran - Ho dynasties culture.
Called Hao Thanh, the system of water trench surrounded the Thanh Noi and connected with Buoi River through a canal at the southeast corner of the citadel.
The Hao Thanh had four stone bridges over to the Thanh Noi at the four gates.
Nowadays, many parts of the Hao Thanh have been filled and dried.
However, the traces of the Hao Thanh still can be seen very clearly in the north, east and south of the citadel.
The La Thanh, the outer wall of the citadel built to protect the Thanh Noi was home to residents in the citadel.
The La Thanh was approximately 10km in perimeter and its construction based on the natural terrain.
The Ho Dynasty built the La Thanh by banking up and making bamboo hedge to connect the mountains of Don Son (Vinh Thanh Commune), Hac Khuyen (Vinh Long Commune), Xuan Dai, Trac Phong, Tien Sy (Vinh Ninh Commune), Kim Ngo (Vinh Tien Commune), Kim Nguu, Tuong Son (Vinh Quang Commune) with two rivers of Buoi and Ma.
Now, the trace of La Thanh in Beo Village (Vinh Long Commune) with a length of 2,051.9m, a height of about 5m, trapezoid section of 9.2m, the base of the citadel of 37m has been localized for protection.
The Nam Giao Altar, an importance royal architectural work, was built in 1402 in the southwest of Don Son Mountain, on the spiritual pathway directly connected with the Southern gate, about 2.5 km away from the citadel of the Ho Dynasty to the southeast.
The Nam Giao Altar has an area of 43,000m².
Currently, the altar appears 5 grounds with 5 terraces.
There is a difference of 7.80 meters between the highest and the lowest.
The Nam Giao Altar is the place to sacrifice to the heaven; pray for harmonious rain and wind, peaceful country and happy people, prosperous and everlasting dynasty.
In addition, the altar is also the place to sacrifice to the soul of dead kings, stars and many other genies.
Nam Giao ceremony is considered as a royal ritual.
The first Nam Giao ceremony of the Ho Dynasty was held in the same year of constructing the altar.
At the citadel of the Ho Dynasty, apart from construction of the Nam Giao Altar and performance of Nam Giao ceremony in 1402, the Ho Dynasty had left historical marks such as establishing Xa Tac Altar (altar of the Earth Genie and the Shennong - the Divine Farmer) in 1397, organizing two state exams in 1400 and 1405.
In addition, the Ho Dynasty had been associated with remarkable innovations, such as reforming examination, building more schools, heightening the Nom scripts and issuing paper-money.

TRANG AN LANDSCAPE COMPLEX ()
(TITC) - Trang An Landscape Complex covers an area of 6,172ha in districts of Hoa Lu, Gia Vien, Nho Quan, Tam Diep Town and Ninh Binh City, about 90km to the southeast of Ha Noi.
The complex is surrounded by a buffer zone of 6,268ha, mostly comprising paddy rice fields and villages.
As a mixed cultural and natural property, Trang An Landscape Complex contains three protected areas, including Hoa Lu Ancient Citadel Cultural – Historical Area; Trang An – Tam Coc – Bich Dong Scenic Area and Hoa Lu Special-Use Primary Forest.
Located in the humid tropical region, Trang An Landscape Complex is a mountainous area that extends in a northwest-southeast direction.
To the north and northwest of Trang An lie Bai Dinh karst hills; to the southwest and the south are Dong Tam – Son Ha and Tam Coc – Bich Dong karst ranges; to the southeast and northeast is Truong Yen karst range; to the northeast and the north is Trang An karst range.
River network in Trang An is well developed with Hoang Long River to the north, Chanh River to the east, He River to the south, Ben Dang River to the west and river systems of Sao Khe, Ngo Dong and Den Voi in the heart of the heritage.
Trang An Area was invaded and reworked by the sea many times in the recent geological past but is now emergent on land.
Landform development over a period of more than five million years produced scenic landscape of extraordinary beauty – a blend of towering cliff-bounded mountains draped in natural rain forest, surrounded by huge and deeply developed internal basins whose clear and quietly flowing waters are connected through a myriad of underground streams and caverns, many of which are navigable by small sampans carrying tourists.
Outstanding values
Cultural value
Trang An is a prominent place in Southeast Asia and the world which contains abundant archaeological evidences preserved almost intactly, mostly shells, animal bones, pottery, stone tools, kitchen floor and human remains.
This is an extremely valuable documentary treasure demonstrating the way that prehistoric human interacted with natural landscape and adapted to major changes of environment over more than 30,000 years, at least since the late Ice Age.
During this time, they endured some of the most turbulent climatic and geographical changes in the Earth's history.
Besides, cultural and historical relics such as pagodas, temples, palaces in Trang An also contribute to consolidating many archaeological documents.
Aesthetic value
The karst tower landscape of Trang An is among the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places of its kind anywhere in the world. Dominating the landscape is a spectacular array of cone-shaped rock towers whose sheer vertical walls rise abruptly 200m above the surrounding land and water.
Narrow interconnecting ridges, which have been likened to mythical giant swords, enclose circular and linear depressions whose expansive waterways are linked by gently flowing streams winding through subterranean caverns up to one kilometer in length. Visitors, carried through these passages in small traditional sampans, can enjoy the multitude of fascinating carbonate stalactites, curtains and other decorations that adorn the ceilings.
Several historic temples and pagodas, some perched high on the valley walls and peaks, signify the important spiritual and religious associations with the landscape.
The countryside of the surrounding buffer zone presents a picture of traditional rural life with gardens and fields among small villages linked by simple tracks, narrow roads and a network of streams and canals.
Geological and geomorphological value
Trang An displays the end stages of karst tower landscape evolution in a humid tropical environment.
The product of deep dissection of an uplifted limestone massif over a period of millions years is a remarkable array of classical karst landforms, including cones and towers, depressions (cockpits), valleys (poljes), rockfall collapse structures and deposits, subterranean caverns and rivers, caves and speleothems.
A network of cross-cutting parallel faults divides the area into cells and promotes the development of enclosed depressions.
An altitudinal series of erosional notches in rock walls with associated caves, wave-cut platforms, beach deposits and marine shells is evidence of former stands of sea level.
On 23 June 2014, in Doha (Qatar), World Heritage Committee of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized officially Trang An Landscape Complex as World Cultural and Natural Heritage Site based on three criteria: culture, aestheticism and geology – geomorphology.
Main tourist sites

NHA NHAC, VIETNAMESE COURT MUSIC (INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE)
In its ordinary meaning, Court Music is understood as music genres, including music for dance and opera, used in worshiping ceremonies, national court – organized festivities, and occasions of entertainment for Kings and Royal families.
But the term Nha Nhac (imported from China) was used by Vietnamese feudal dynasties from the Ho Dynasty with different meanings, for example sometimes indicating general court music, sometimes court ritual music in particular, sometimes indicating music department, even a concrete orchestra.
The initial foundation of Nha Nhac – the Vietnamese Court Music began conceiving since the 13th century but it only reached the peak at the Hue Court under the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945). The Court Music was officially formed along with the rise of Nguyen Dynasty in the early 19th century.
In about 1947, 1948, Madame Tu Cung (mother of King Bao Dai, wife of King Khai Dinh) gathered once again some court music artists, helping to maintain some genres of Hue Court Music and dance.
In the 1980s, it began to attract attention of the Ministry of Culture and local authorities.
In the 1990s, Hue Court Music enjoyed renaissance.
Thereafter Hue Court Music has been introduced much abroad.
The different genres of the Hue Court Music include worshiping ritual music, court ritual music, court dances, chamber music and opera (royal classical opera - tuong).
In the former times, Hue Court Music consisted of various genres: Giao Nhac used in the sacrifice ceremony to the Heaven and the Earth. Mieu Nhac used in worshipping ceremonies at the temples of meritorious ancestors of the Nguyen clan, Confucius, Nguyen Dynasty's literature doctors, national heroes; Ngu Tu Nhac used in Than Nong, Thanh Hoang, Xa Tac worshiping ceremonies; Dai Trieu Nhac used in great ceremonies or receptions of foreign ambassadors; Thuong Trieu Nhac used in ordinary court ceremonies; Yen Nhac used in great royal banquets; Cung Nhac (or Cung Trung Nhac) used inside the royal palaces.
Former Hue court dances were rich and performed on many occasions.
The 11 court dances remained until now are composed of Bat Dat (used in Giao, Mieu, Xa Tac, historical kings and Confucius worshipping ceremonies); Luc cung, Tam tinh, Bat tien, Dau Chien thang Phat, Tu Linh, Tam quoc Tay Du (used in van tho - King’s birthday, thanh tho - birthday of King’s mother, tien tho - birthday of Hoang Thai Phi (the imperial concubine of King’s late father) and the Mu (a Fairy or Guardian angel) worshipping ceremonies); and thien xuan (birthday of the prince – the successor to the throne); Trinh tuong tap khanh (used in tu, ngu tuan dai khanh ceremonies for wealthy people and powerful country; Nu tuong xuat quan (used on the Days of Victory, Nguyen Dynasty Enthroning Day, lunar - calendar May 2nd, at great night banquets and receptions of foreign ambassadors); Vu phien (devoted to the King's Mother, wife, ladies-in-waiting, princesses at weddings); Luc triet hoa ma dang (on Nguyen Dynasty Enthroning Day for the watching of the people masses in the front of Phu Van Lau).
The repertoire for court music genres mentioned above consisted of a variety musical pieces.
Yet, in the declining stages, many of them were lost; only the words have been remained.
The pieces still preserved are Muoi ban ngu ( or lien bo thap chuong - suite composed of 10 pieces including: Pham tuyet, Nguyen tieu, Ho quang, Lien hoan, Binh ban, Tay mai, Kim tien, Xuan phong, Long ho, Tau ma), Long dang, Long ngam, Phu luc, Tieu khuc, Tam luan cuu chuyen - ritual music asking for good rains, Dang dan cung, Dang dan don, Dang dan kep, Thai binh co nhac, Bong, Ma vu, Man and some other pieces of chamber music such as Nam Binh and Nam Ai, etc.
Nguyen Dynasty court orchestras were divers in type and number of instruments, depending on the kind of royal rituals and entertainment. There were many kinds of orchestra for example Nha nhac, Huyen nhac, Ti truc te nhac, Tieu nhac, Dai nhac, Co xuy dai nhac, Nhac Thieu, Bat am, Ty chung, Ty khanh, Ty co, etc.
Hue Court Music succeeded and enhanced the achievements of Thang Long Court Music – formed many centuries ago - to a new height.
This succession and enhancement are shown in: Maintaining some court orchestras of the previous dynasties (the most distinctive of which are Tran Dynasty's Tieu nhac and Dai nhac) and creating rich variations based on Le Dynasty ‘s orchestras;
The continuing use of many common musical instruments of Thang Long Royal Music;
Maintaining and diversifying some previous court dances, at the same time creating many new dances;
Creating a new type of chamber music (don ca Hue) and enhancing Vietnamese instrumental music to a new height both in performance techniques and forms of ensemble;
Succeeding the Dang ngoai "tuong" and bringing it to flourish simultaneously forming a new specific kind of tuong: the "tuong Kinh" (tuong of the capital city) in the style of "tuong van";
Succeeding the system of tone regulations of the Hong Duc time under Le Dynasty in the second half of the 15thcentury and developing music language and theory;
Continuing the traditions of learning, adopting and Vietnamising foreign music elements that were shaped in Vietnamese music in general and in Thang Long Court Music in particular…
The special traits of Hue Court Music is the process of integrating, adopting and modifying Chinese, Champa cultures and Buddhist, Confucian impacts.
Court Music is closely connected with "tuong" (hat boi) art.
Hue Court Music synthetizes itself the abundance and diversity in many aspects including the art-type aspect, the genre aspect, types of instrument and timbre, in repertoires, in kinds of orchestra organization and ensemble forms, the performance environment and melody…
So Hue Court Music could satisfy both the spectators’ audition and vision by its abundance "dishes of different tastes".
The Hue Court Music has large scale and highly professional:
As the official music of the state, it consists of many large scale orchestras, many music and dance items were performed by a big staff of instrumentalists, singers and dancers.
Moreover, this is the music genre that has high degree of improvisation and variation of the melodious scheme.
At the official meeting of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) in Paris, Nha nhac, Vietnamese Court Music, thatHue has preserved so long, was officially listed by UNESCO among masterpieces of the Oral and intangible heritage of humanity on 7th November 2003.
This is the first intangible heritage of Viet Nam ever listed in this list, recognized the achievements of 10-year process of striving, tireless preparation of the central, local governments and the Hue Monuments Conservation Centre.

THE SPACE OF GONG CULTURE IN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS (INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE)
The space of gong culture in Central Highlands of Viet Nam covers 5 provinces of Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Dak Nong and Lam Dong. The masters of gong culture are the ethnic groups of Ba Na, Xo Dang, M’Nong, Co Ho, Ro Mam, E De, Gia Rai… 
The gong performances are always closely tied to community cultural rituals and ceremonies of the ethnic groups in Central Highlands.
The gongs are made of brass alloy or a mixture of brass and gold, silver, bronze.
Their diameter is from 20cm to 60cm or from 90cm to 120cm.
A set of gongs consists of 2 to 12 or 13 units and even to 18 or 20 units in some places.
In most of ethnic groups, namely Gia Rai, Ede Kpah, Ba Na, Xo Dang, Brau, Co Ho, etc., only males are allowed to play gongs. However, in others such as Ma and M’Nong groups, both males and females can play gongs.
Few ethnic groups (for example, E De Bih), gongs are performed by women only.
As for the majority of ethnic groups in Central Highlands, gongs are musical instruments of sacred power.
It is believed that every gong is the settlement of a god who gets more powerful as the gong is older.
In Central Highlands, gongs are often performed in the form of orchestra.

Instruments for Don ca tai tu performance include the moon-shaped lute (kim), two-stringed fiddle (co), 16-string zither (tranh), pear-shaped lute (ty ba), percussion (song lang), monochord (bau) and bamboo flute (sao).
The violin and guitar are adapted. The guitar used by Don ca tai tu artists has a deep, hollowed-out finger board, enabling musicians to play special ornamentation characteristic of Don ca tai tu.
Don ca tai tu practitioners include master instrumentalists (thay don), who are highly skillful at playing and teaching numerous instruments and who have mastered all of the classical repertoire; master lyricists (thay tuong), who are knowledgeable and experienced at composing new song texts; master singers (thay ca), who have mastered the classical repertoire and who can perform and teach the distinctive Don ca tai tu vocal techniques and ornamentation.

The traditional method of oral transmission as truyen ngon, truyen khau, which literally means “transmitting through the fingers and through the mouth”. For this traditional method, the master instrumentalists and singers directly teach learners who are members of ensembles, clubs or families. The second method combines traditional oral methods of transmission with a syllabus in many of the national and provincial schools of art and culture.
Instrumentalists must study for at least three years in order to learn basic instrumental techniques, such as tremolo, glissando, trills, vibrato...
They learn to perform solo or with other musicians in duets, trios, quartets, quintets or sextets. Vocal learners, performing either solo or in a duet, study the traditional songs.

Tugging rituals and games are often organized in front of a village’s communal house.
The materials used in tugging vary from region to region; they can be made of bamboo poles, rattan cords, or hemp, reflecting the ecological and cultural context of each community.
Each tugging game has the participants of two teams with equal number of members.

WOODBLOCKS OF NGUYEN DYNASTY (WORLD DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE)
Under the Nguyen Dynasty, due to the need to popularize social standards, compulsory articles of law, Kings’ and Lords’ life and career and historical events...
the Imperial Court allowed to carve many sets of history books and literature work for delivering.
During the past activities, it helped to form a special type of record, which are the woodblocks.
These are the unique original records.
The Woodblocks of Nguyen Dynasty was assessed in the heritage records as follows:
The 34,555 plates of wood-blocks of the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945) helped to record official literature and history as well as classic and historical books.
Their value is at once documentary and artistic.
Their technique furthermore represents a landmark in the development of woodblock carving and printing in Viet Nam.
Their importance and high value led feudal dynasties and state authorities to pay considerable attention to preserving these records through the ages.
The woodblock is a plate of wood on which words written in Chinese or Chinese transcribed Vietnamese were carved in reverse as a popular method of printing books in the Nguyen Dynasty.
At present, 34,555 plates of woodblocks of Nguyen Dynasty are being preserved in the National Archive Center 4 - under the State Records and Archives Department of Viet Nam (at No.2 Yet Kieu Str., Da Lat City).
The Woodblocks of Nguyen Dynasty were created primarily during the past activities of the Historiographer's Office of Nguyen Dynasty (established in 1820 under the Minh Mang reign) in Hue.
Apart from the woodblocks of official literature and history of Nguyen Dynasty, woodblocks also included classic and historical books which were collected from the Temple of Literature of Imperial College (Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam) in Hanoi and transferred to Imperial College (Quoc Tu Giam) in Hue under the reigns of Minh Mang and Thieu Tri.
Since 1960, the Woodblocks of Nguyen Dynasty have been transferred to Da Lat.
The woodblocks represent an important part of the country’s feudal history. They are original with clear origin from its creation. Most of them were compiled by the Court on the basis of official documents, which were carefully verified and were managed by state bodies through different historical periods.
Due to such significant characteristics, woodblocks were considered as national treasure in feudal period, which could only be accessed by authorized people and people in Historiography's Office.
Regarding method of making the records, this is a close procedure costing a lot of time and effort: Firstly, the King launched a royal decree to allow to compile book.
Then the Historiographer's Office was responsible in researching, editing, carving and printing those kinds of books.
It researched old books and Imperial records to compile books. The completed manuscript was submitted to the King.
Then this manuscript was sent back to the Office and they corrected as the King’s suggestions.
After that, this manuscript was written down clearly and submitted with a petition to the King.
After being approved, the manuscripts of the works were carved on woodblocks under the close control of the mandarins who were appointed by the king's edict.
Then, woodblocks were used to print into books.
People could only carve books under the Kings’ order.
To manipulate the records, the Historiographer's Office had to recruit many skilled carvers.
The carvers selected from widely in localities across the country where is famous for wood carving, and the carving techniques were entirely manual.
The words were carved on wood as contained all the enthusiasm of each worker.
Each character engraved on the wood is very delicate and sharp.
Each record is not only precious material but also a unique work of art. Therefore, apart from historical value, the woodblocks also have artistic values and values in manipulating technique, marking the development of woodblocks carving and printing profession in Viet Nam.
According to some documents, most of the wood blocks are made of thi tree wood and the nha dong tree, which is both soft and smooth with an ivory colour. These kinds of wood are especially good for preserving the shape of the carvings.
Therefore, even gone through hundreds of years the woodblocks have been still in good physical condition.
In addition, le and tao trees are also used for carving woodblocks.
The collection boasts many valuable and rare wood blocks, including Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chi (History of the Unification of Great Viet Nam) and Dai Nam Thuc Luc (Royal Annals of Great Viet Nam), Kham dinh Viet su thong giam cuong muc, Kham dinh Dai Nam hoi dien su le...
They also include poems and literature works written by prominent kings like Minh Mang, Thieu Tri and Tu
Nowadays, woodblocks on the field of official literature and history of feudal dynasties like this kind of the documents are specially valuable and rare records of Viet Nam and also quite rare in the world.
These records formed during the past activities of the Emperor and bodies under the feudal machinery of administration in Nguyen Dynasty.
Woodblocks are sources of reliable history to help to study, compare, review relevant history materials to serve better for researching in the fields of Vietnamese history.
On 30th July 2009, the woodblocks of the Nguyen Dynasty have been recognized as a World Documentary Heritage at the meeting of the International Advisory Committee (IAC) of the UNESCO in Bridgetown (Barbados), from the 29th to the 31st of July 2009.

The Woodblocks of Nguyen Dynasty are particularly rare documents in Viet Nam as well as in the world.
STONE STELE RECORDS OF ROYAL EXAMINATIONS OF THE LE AND MAC DYNASTIES (WORLD DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE)
Stone steles in Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam include 82 steles which record the royal examinations of Le and Mac dynasties (1442-1779).
All steles are put on stone tortoises’ back to represent everlasting national quintessence and reflect historical and cultural values of Viet Nam through 300 years.
In 1484, King Le Thanh Tong gave an order to erect the first 10 steles for the royal examinations held in 1442, 1448, 1463, 1466, 1469, 1472, 1475, 1478, 1481 and 1484 under Le So Dynasty.
However, now only 7 steles remain.
In next years, Le So Dynasty had 5 steles erected for the royal examinations held in 1487, 1496, 1502, 1511 and 1514.
Under Mac Dynasty, only 2 steles were erected for the royal examinations held in 1518 (under Le So Dynasty) and 1529 because of civil war.
Under Le Trung Hung Dynasty, the royal examinations were restored and hold regularly. In 1653, Le Trung Hung Dynasty had the most number of steles erected in Temple of Literature with 25 steles for the royal examinations held between 1554 and 1652.
Then in 1717, 21 steles were erected for the royal examinations held between 1656 and 1712.
With two large courses of stele erection and next regular stele erections, Le Trung Hung Dynasty had most steles erected in Temple of Literature (68/82).
Under Tay Son (1788 - 1802) and Nguyen (1802 - 1945) dynasties, capital city was removed to Phu Xuan – Hue and steles were not erected in Van Mieu (Ha Noi) any more.
Nguyen Dynasty gave an order to erect steles in Van Mieu (Hue) from the royal examination held in 1822.
All the 82 steles are of the same model: the slab is flat with an arched pediment and tortoise-shaped base; the tortoise is rather big and looks strong; the steles are of different sizes.
The steles are also unique in terms of their construction: stone was carefully selected, designed, decorated, and engraved with texts.
This work must have required extraordinary patience and skill as it was done entirely by hand.
The 82 steles in Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam are unique ones in the world which have inscriptions. Their inscriptions record not only the names of the laureates of royal examinations held through nearly 300 years (1442 – 1779) but also information on history of the royal examinations; the successive dynasties’ conceptions of education, training and employing talent and their philosophy of state governance. Therefore the steles had a great social impact on education and training of talented citizens, encouraged contemporary people and people of the following generations in education.
The inscriptions also contain such details as the date of the stele’s erection and the names and official posts of the inscription compilers, revisers, calligraphers, and engravers.
It affirms that the steles are original, authentic and unique.
Each stele is a true work of art as they are the results of master mind and hands of the best scholars, engravers and calligraphers over times.
They are of great significance to the study of ancient documents in Chinese as the texts were written in Chinese characters, but read in Vietnamese way of pronunciation, so they can serve as references for those who study the former Vietnamese languages.
Furthermore, these steles furnish valuable information about Vietnamese emissaries that would contribute to the study of diplomatic relations between Viet Nam and other Northeast Asian countries.
Among the 1304 doctoral laureates whose names are recorded on the steles, 225 were once assigned diplomatic missions to China under Ming and Qing dynasties.
Using the steles as reliable documents, Vietnamese and foreign scholars can study the history, education and culture of Viet Nam in the past, and young generations can absorb the traditions and values left by their ancestors.
Moreover, each stele is itself a vivid work of art with various designs: flowers, leaves, clouds, the moon; or the dragon, holy lion, tortoise and phoenix.
Steles of each historic period are distinct from those of other periods. Distinctive features such as designs, decorative patterns, tortoise-shaped bases, and the type of Chinese characters used for their inscriptions preserve the steles’ originality and prevent attempts to produce replicas.
Many art researchers consider the steles as important documents to study Vietnamese history of art and sculpture from the 15th to the 18th centuries.
At present, the 82 steles in Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam are still unique ones preserved constantly on the spot since they were erected.
The inscriptions on all the steles are, in general, readable.
The irreplaceability and rarity lie in the content of the steles, the mode and condition of their establishment, their historical and artistic value, and their social impact. They are lively evidence of the intellect, aptitude and dexterity of the Vietnamese people.
On March 9, 2010 in Macau, China, the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee of Memory of the World recognized 82 steles which record the royal examinations of Le and Mac dynasties in Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam as world documentary heritage in the Memory of the World Program of UNESCO.

Religion and Belief
The major religious traditions in Viet Nam are Buddhism (which fuses forms of Taoism and Confusianism), Christianity (Catholicism and Protestantism), Islam, Caodaism and the Hoa Hao sect.
Buddhism
Buddhism was first introduced to Viet Nam in the 2nd century, and reached its peak in the Ly dynasty (11th century). It was then regarded as the official religion dominating court affairs.
Buddhism was preached broadly among the population and it enjoyed a profound influence on people's daily life. Its influence also left marks in various areas of traditional literature and architecture.
As such, many pagodas and temples were built during this time.
At the end of the 14th century, Buddhism began to show signs of decline. The ideological influence of Buddhism, however, remained very strong in social and cultural life.
Presenty, over 70 percent of the population of Viet Nam are either Buddhist or strongly influenced by Buddhist practices.
Catholicism
Catholicism was introduced to Viet Nam in the 17th century. At present the most densely-populated Catholic areas are Bui Chu-Phat Diem in the northern province of Ninh Binh and Ho Nai-Bien Hoa in Dong Nai Province to the South.
About 10 percent of the population are considered Catholic.
Protestantism
Protestantism was introduced to Viet Nam at about the same time as Catholicism. Protestantism, however, remains an obscure religion.
At present most Protestants live in the Central Highlands.
There still remains a Protestant church on Hang Da Street in Ha Noi.
The number of Protestants living in Viet Nam is estimated at 400,000.
Islam
Islamic followers in Viet Nam are primarily from the Cham ethnic minority group living in the central part of the central coast. The number of Islamic followers in Viet Nam totals about 50,000.
Caodaism
Caodaism was first introduced to the country in 1926.
Settlements of the Cao Dai followers in South Viet Nam are located near the Church in Tay Ninh.
The number of followers of this sect is estimated at 2 million.
Hoa Hao Sect
The Hoa Hao Sect was first introduced to Viet Nam in 1939.
More than 1 million Vietnamese are followers of this sect. Most of them live in the south-west of Viet Nam.
Mother Worship (Tho Mau)
The mother worship cult might be originated from the cult of the Goddess in ancient ages.
In the Middle Ages, the Mother was worshipped in temples and palaces.
The custom of Mother worship originated from the north. In the south, the religion has integrated the local goddesses such as Thien Y A Na (Hue) and Linh Son (Tay Ninh).
In fact, the Mother worship cult was influenced by other religions, mainly Taoism.
Worship of Hung Kings
(TITC) - The worship of Hung Kings originates from Hung Kings dynasty and had strongly developed for a long time before officially honored in Post Le Dynasty (1428 – 1788).
The later dynasties and Vietnamese Government always pay attention and encourage people to maintain the worship of Hung Kings.
Every year, on the 10th day of the third lunar month, Hung Kings Ancestral Anniversary day is held at Hung Kings temples nationwide, of which biggest one takes place in Hung Kings Temple Relic Site (Phu Tho Province).
In Phu Tho, each village selects a Festival Organizing Board (Ban Khanh Tiet) of 6-9 mature, knowledgeable individuals of good conducts who lead and manage the rituals.
The Board appoints suitably expert temple guardians to tend worship sites, instruct devotees and offer incense to Hung Kings year round.
The offerings for the ceremonies (opening, procession, closing) are carefully prepared including sticky rice, fruit, wine, rice, salt, boiled chicken, raw pork (black pig), chung cake and day cake...
The worship ritual consists of incense burning, offerings presenting, testament reading, praying, performance of traditional art such as bronze drum beating, Xoan singing...
During the festival, folk games are also organized such as catching a goat while blindfolded, tug of war, flag scoop, boat racing, duck catching in pond...
With unique and distinct values, on 6 December 2012, in Paris (France), UNESCO officially recognized the worship of Hung Kings in Phu Tho Province as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
This is the first belief in Viet Nam recognized as world heritage.
Worship of Ancestor Custom
Tet of Vietnamese
Vietnamese have many festivals in year, of which Lunar New Year Festival (Tet Nguyen dan) is the biggest festival, besides numerous other unique festivals.
Lunar New Year Festival
Tet Nguyen dan is the biggest and most sacred festival. Tet falls on a time when the old year is over and the New Year comes by lunar calendar (from the eve of the last lunar month to the 3rd day of the first lunar month).
This is also the time when the cycle of the universe finishes: winter ends and spring, the season of birth of all living things, comes.
Tet is an occasion for pilgrims and family reunions. It is a time when Vietnamese pay respect to ancestors and grandparents, everyone sends each other best wishes for a new year, stops thinking about unhappy things and says good things about each other.
Tet Nguyen tieu (Tet Thuong nguyen)
Tet Nguyen tieu falls on the 15th day of the first lunar month.
Most Vietnamese people believe that the first full moon of the New Year is the most important among all full moons throughout the year.
On this day, people often go to pagodas to pray for the best things coming to every family members and their beloved friends.
Tet Thanh minh (Serene sky)
Tet Han Thuc (Cold goods)
Tet Han Thuc takes place on the 3rd day of the third lunar month.
Tet Doan Ngo (Killing Insects Day)
Tet Doan Ngo falls on the 5th day of the fifth lunar month.
On the day of “killing insects”, every one has to get up early, eat fermented sticky and fruits.
Tet Trung Nguyen
Tet Trung Nguyen takes place on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month in pagodas and Vietnamese families. This day is held to forgive the lost souls, to fulfill filial duty, and to remember the dead. Shoes and dresses made of paper, along with votive paper, are burnt in every household.
Tet Trung thu (Mid-Autumn Festival)
Tet Trung thu on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month is a joyful occasion for children to enjoy several activities, such as singing, lion dancing, parading with lanterns shaped as moon and stars, and eating banh nuong, banh deo (moon cakes).
Tet Ha Nguyen (New Rice Festival)
Tet Ha Nguyen takes place on the 1st day or the 15th day of the tenth lunar month.
In Vietnamese rural areas, this festival is held with large scale, because this is a chance to cook new rice, first to worship ancestors and then reward effort of farmers.
Tet Tao Quan (Kitchen Gods Day)
Tet Tao Quan is on the 23rd day of the last lunar month, the day when Kitchen Gods (Tao Quan) visit to Heaven to deliver an annual report on the household’s activities to the God of Heaven.
After the Kitchen Gods go to Heaven, Vietnamese people normally tidy and decorate their houses to welcome New Year.
Villages - Guilds
The Vietnamese culture has always evolved on the basis of the wet rice civilization.
Thus, the lifestyle of the Vietnamese population is closely related to its village and native lands.
In Vietnamese society, people gather together to form villages in rural areas, and guilds in urban areas.
Villages and guilds have been forming since the dawn of the nation.
These organizations have gradually developed for the population to be more stable and closer together.
Each village and guild has its own regulations called conventions.
The purpose of these conventions is the promotion of good customs within populations. All the conventions are different but they are always in accordance with the state laws.
Approximately ten thousands such conventions are kept in the History Museum in Ha Noi and in other museums throughout the country.
Funeral Ceremony
“The sense of the dead is that of the final,” says a Vietnamese proverb, meaning that funeral ceremonies must be solemnly organized.
Formerly funeral ceremonies went as following: the body was washed and dressed; then a le ngam ham, or chopstick, was laid between the teeth and a pinch of rice and three coins were dropped in the mouth.
Then the body was put on a grass mat laid on the ground according to the saying “being born from the earth, one must return back to the earth.”
The dead body was enveloped with white cloth, le kham liem, and put into the coffin, le nhap quan.
Finally, the funeral ceremony, le thanh phuc, was officially performed.
The deceased person’s sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law had to wear coarse gauze turbans and tunics, and hats made of straw or of dry banana fiber.
The deceased person’s grandchildren and relatives also had to wear mourning turbans.
During the days when the dead were still laid out at home, the mourning went on with worshipping meals and mourning music. Relatives, neighbours, and friends came to offer their condolences.
The date and time for the funeral procession, le dua tang, must be carefully selected.
Relatives, friends, and descendants take part in the funeral procession to accompany the dead along the way to the burial ground. Votive papers were dropped along the way.
At the grave site, the coffin is buried and covered.
After three days of mourning, the family visits the tomb again, le mo cua ma or worship the opening the grave; after 49 days, le chung that, the family stops bringing rice for the dead to the altar.
And finally, after 100 days, the family celebrates tot khoc, or the end of the tears.
After one year is the ceremony of the first anniversary of the relative’s death and after two years is the ceremony of the end of mourning.
Nowadays, mourning ceremonies follow new rituals which are simplified; they consist of covering and putting the dead body into the coffin, the funeral procession, the burial of the coffin into the grave, and the visits to the tomb.
The deceased person’s family members wear a white turban or a black mourning band.
Customs of Chewing Betel and Areca Nuts and smoking thuoc lao
According to legends, chewing quid of betel and areca has been a custom since the Hung Vuong period and is connected to the antique legend of betel and areca.
A quid of betel, also called trau, is composed of four elements: an areca leaf (sweet taste), betel bark (hot taste), a chay root (bitter taste), and hydrated lime (pungent taste).
The custom of chewing betel nut is unique to Viet Nam.
Old health books claim that "chewing betel and areca nut makes the mouth fragrant, decreases bad tempers, and makes digesting food easy".
A quid of betel makes people become closer and more openhearted.
At any wedding ceremony, there must be a dish of betel and areca nut, which people can share as they enjoy the special occasion. During festivals or Tet Holidays, betel and areca nut is used for inviting visitors and making acquaintances. Sharing a quid of betel with an old friend is like expressing gratitude for the relationship.
A quid of betel and areca nut makes people feel warm on cold winters days, and during funerals it relieves sadness. Betel and areca nuts are also used in offerings.
When Vietnamese people worship their ancestors, betel and areca nut must be present at the altar.
For women, betel can initiate various feminine conversation, but for men, thuoc lao is related to their joyfulness as well as the sadness in their lives.
Peasants always carry their dieu cay (pipe for smoking while ploughing the rice fields).
Wedding Ceremony
Language and Scripts
Among the 54 Vietnamese ethnic groups some have had their own scripts for a long time and some have not preserved their ancient scripts.
Throughout the years, these languages have been enriched in terms of vocabulary, precision, and expression.
However, the Viet language is most commonly used.
In terms of script, for a long time under northern domination, han (Chinese) was widely used in trade, education and state documents.
This lasted until the beginning of 20th century.
During the ten century, parallel to the use of han, the Vietnamese created the nom script, which used the pictography of han to note the sounds of the Viet language.
The appearance of the nom script marked a point of maturity in the national conscious of the Viet, and led to the development of literature in Viet Nam.
In the 16th century, quoc ngu (a Romanized script produced by French missionaries) appeared and was substituted for both the han and nom scripts.
Folk Literature
Since coming into existence, Vietnamese literature has been rich in folklore and proverbs; tales that have been handed down from generation to generation, gradually becoming valuable treasures.
The Muong ethnic group in northern Trung Bo has an epic poem called “de dat, de nuoc” (giving birth to the earth and water), whie the Thai ethnic group in the north-west has “xong chu xon xao” (seeing off and instructing the loving heart). This list could go on for quite some time.
Overview of traditional festivals
Festive activities are living museums in which typical cultural values of the nation have been preserved for centuries.
Formation and meaning of traditional festivals
Traditional festivals constitute a form of cultural activities, a spiritual product which the people have created and developed during the course of history.
From generation to generation, the Vietnamese people preserve the fine tradition of “remembering the source while drinking water.”
Festivals are events which represent this tradition of the community as well as honour the holy figures named as “gods” – the real persons in national history or legendary persons.
The images of gods converge the noble characteristics of mankind.
They are national heroes who fought against foreign invaders, reclaimed new lands, treated people, fought against natural calamities, or those legendary characters who affect the earthly life.
Festivals are events when people pay tribute to divinities that rendered merits to the community and the nation.
Festivals are occasions when people come back to either their natural or national roots, which form a sacred part in their mind.
Festivals represent the strength of the commune or village, the local region or even the whole nation.
Worshipping the same god, the people unite in solidarity to overcome difficulties, striving for a happy and wealthy life.
Festivals display the demand for creativity and enjoyment of spiritual and material cultural values of all social strata.
Festivals become a form of education under which fine traditional moral values can be handed from one generation to the next in a unique way of combining spiritual characters with competition and entertainment games.
Festivals are also the time people can express their sadness and worries in a wish that gods might bestow favour on them to help them strive for a better life.
Process of festivals
Generally speaking, every festival will include the following three steps:
Preparation: The preparation work is divided into two phases: prior to the coming festive season and in the immediate time before the festive day.
The preparation work for the coming festive season starts right after the previous festival comes to an end.
When it is coming to the festive day, people need to check the worshipping objects, attires, decoration, and cleaning of the worshipping place and statues.
The festive day: Many activities take place, including rituals of procession, incense offering, and rejoicing games, among others.
They form the most important and significant part of any festival.
These activities also play a decisive role in attracting tourists and deciding the timing of the festival itself.
The ending of the festival: The organization board expresses their thanks to all festival goers and closes the worshipping place.
Time for festivals
In Viet Nam festivals often take place during the three months in spring and in autumn when people have a lot of leisure time.
In addition, the climate in spring and autumn is especially suitable for holding festivals and for festivals goers to enjoy.
Festival rituals
Festivals require many compulsory rituals, which are carried out in a strict order from the preparation to the ending of a festival.
In general, a festival has the following rituals:
Statue washing rite is performed at mid-night of the day before the festival.
This rite is preceded by a ceremony of water procession in some places.
A ceremony to inform gods must be held prior to this statue-washing rite.
Next is the rite of wearing hats and costumes for gods’ statues or putting them in their worshipping tablets if gods have no statue.
After that, the statues of gods (or worshipping tablets, even costumes) are put in the palanquin, ready for the procession on the opening of the festival.
Procession ritual: A festival often includes the procession of gods, tutelary gods, royal order and water, of which the first and fourth rite are most popular.
The content and meaning of the procession ritual vary from festival to festival with regard to the object of procession, its organization and participants.
The procession of gods and water processions are usually carried out prior to the opening and closing ceremonies of the festival accordingly.
Festivals, as mentioned above, are to honour holy figures, i.e.gods or divinities to whose temples and shrines are dedicated.
Very often a festival takes place in the courtyard of the village’s communal house which is spacious and convenient for the conduct of liturgical processes and rejoicing activities.
As such, the ritual of god procession is held along the route from their places of worship to the place of liturgy. At the end of the festival, another procession will bring gods’ statues back to their temples.
After the procession ritual are the ritual of presenting offerings to gods and the opening of the festival.
In many festivals, a procession of the oration dedicated to gods is held every day.
Each day a different oration is used.
In traditional festivals it is required that participants in the procession ritual must be men above 18 years old who are selected carefully on the basis of their physical strength and good ethics. Women can join the procession group in such festivals as Phu Day or Ha Loi which dedicate to goddesses.
Anyone who is chosen to become a member of the procession group must consider it his/her own honour and his/her family.
On its way, each procession bears its own symbol.
People beat drums and gongs (formerly firecrackers were used) to signal the departure of the procession.
On the closing day of the festival, a final ritual is held with all processes required.
Rice cooking competitions (thi thoi com)
During Tet, a number of villages in northern and central Viet Nam hold cooking contests that may sound simple, but follow strict and complex rules: Cooking in the wind and rain.
Contests for boys and girls villagers in Chuong Village of Ha Noi organise similar competitions separately for boys and girls.
Female participants must cook rice on the ground while simultaneously carrying a six-to seven-month-old baby from another family on her hip. She must console the infant when he or she cries. At the same time, she must prevent a toad from jumping out of a chalk circle drawn around her.
The contest for boys is no less rigorous.
Each boy must stand ready with all the necessary items (rice, water, matches and firewood) on a light boat moored the pond bank. At a given signal he paddles with his hands to the opposite bank, where a row of pots is placed on tripods.
He must stay in his unmoored boat while cooking the rice on the bank. The least loss of balance tosses him over into the water.
Modern Literature
A revolutionary campaign occurred at the beginning of Romanized Vietnamese literature, in an attempt to standardize its styles such as prose, poetry, and criticism.
All the writings produced had one thing in common: the authors were using a powerful and flexible style to update events and trends and therefore predict social events.
For more than a half century the Vietnamese people fought two wars of resistance, and at the present time, are in a period of construction, industrialization and modernization.
In this situation, in Vietnamese literature, movement and vital force currently exist.
Spinning Tops
Bamboo Jacks
This girls' game (chơi chuyen) includes ten thin, well-sharpened, round bamboo sticks and a ball, which traditionally is a fig, a miniature variety of eggplant, a small rock or a clod of clay.
The player tosses the ball into the air. While the ball is in the air, she must quickly pick up the sticks and then catch the ball.
Kites that make music
Kite flying is popular throughout the year in Viet Nam.
The game of squares
They draw a rectangle on the ground and divide it into ten small squares called "rice fields" or "fish ponds.
"They also draw two additional semi-circular boxes at the two ends of the rectangle, which are called"mandarin's boxes," hence the game's name. Each person has 25 small pebbles and a bigger stone. Each player places the stone in one of the mandarin's boxes and five small pebbles in each of the other squares (see diagram above).
The first player takes up the contents of one square on his or her side of the board (but not a mandarin's box) and distributes the pebbles one by one, starting with the next square in either direction. (Since each square contains five pebbles at the beginning, the first move will distribute five pebbles to the left or right). After the last pebble is distributed, the player takes the contents of the following square and repeats the distribution process.
But if the following square is one of the mandarin's boxes, the turn ends and passes to the other player.If the last pebble falls into a square that precedes one empty square, the player wins all the contents of the square following the empty square and removes these pebbles from the board.
If this square is followed by another empty square, the player wins the contents of the square after that, and so on.
Cat and Mouse Game
Each game requires between seven and ten people.
They stand in a circle, hold hands and raise their hands above their heads.
Then they start singing the song.
Please come over here
Hand in hand
Stand in a large circle
The mouse will run through the hole
The cat will run after it
The Game of the Dragon-Snake
A large group plays the children's game rong ran (dragon-snake). In One person sits on a small hill or some location above the other players; he or she acts as the doctor. The other children stand in a line, holding each other's belts to form the body of the dragon-snake.
The following dialogue occurs between the doctor and the head of the line:
Where are you going, dragon-snake?
- I’m searching for medicine for my son.
- How old is he, your son?
- He is one year old.
- The doctor is not well.
- He is (two, three, four, five... repeated each time) years old. - The doctor is not well. The dialogue continues until the dragon-snake says:
- He is ten years old.
- All right, the doctor is well.
With this, the doctor stands up and says:
- Give me your head
- Nothing but the bones
- Give me the body.
- Nothing but the blood.
- Give me the tail.
- Pursue at will!
At this, the doctor flies into a rage and attempts lo catch the child who represents the tail of the dragon-snake.
Throwing a sacred ball through the ring
Battle of the Chickens
Cock fighting, a long-standing form of popular entertainment, is organised during traditional festivals throughout Viet Nam.

Chanting While Sawing Wood
Two children sit opposite each other, holding each other’s hands tightly.
While reciting a song, they push and pull each other’s arms and pretend as if they are sawing a piece of wood between them.
They say each word as they push or pull.
The song goes as follows:
Keo cua lua xe
The worker who is strong
Returns to eat the king’s rice
The worker who cannot catch up
Returns to suck his mother’s milk
Or, an alternate version:
Keo cua lua xe
Work a little, eat a lot
Sleep wherever we lie down
They steal the saw
How will we saw?

Boat racing
From time immemorial, boat racing has appeared in Viet Nam.
It is not only a competition but also a ritual in honour of the Water God, stemming from the act of praying for water among agricluture-based people.
In some places there are only two boats in competition (in Ðào Xá, Phú Tho), a male boat with the figure of a bird at its head and a female one decorating with a figure of a fish.
These two figures symbolize the yin-yang harmony (bird: in the sky – yang, fish: in the water – yin). The movements of the ores waken up the Water God. This kind of boat racing only takes place at night and ends at the crack of dawn.
For fishermen boat racing conveys their wishes for bumper fish catches.
In other places, boat racing is held to honour general who were good at navy operation.
At present boat racing constitutes an important part in the program of many festivals from the North to the South, especially the localities with rivers and lakes or near the sea.
It has gone beyond a belief activity to become a fascinating sport event, which attracts a large number of participants.
As such, boat racing has become an event to compete and display collective strength.
Word arrangement
This game develops in Hoa Lu, Tam Ðiêp (Ninh Bình).
A word-arrangement team includes 32 boys under 15 years old. They wear blue trousers, leggings, and white shirts with red hem.
They are often divided into two lines with two leaders (tong co tien and tong co hau) standing at either end of each line.
These leaders usually put on white trousers with three-knotted cloth belt, gauze tunics, turbans, holding square flags.
In the game, tong co tien and tong co hau guide their lines to arrange different words in accordance with rounds of drum by tieu canh.
The two leaders direct their line to run spirally with complicated acts to arrange such words as Thai Binh (Great Peace), Thien Phuc (Heaven Luck), or Quoc thai dan an (Peaceful country, prosperous people).

Country's official name
At the beginning of the Bronze Age, the Viet tribe groups had settled down in the North and in the north of Central Viet Nam.
There were about 15 groups of Lac Viet tribesmen living mainly in the northern highland and delta and a dozen Au Viet groups of tribesmen living in Viet Bac, the northern region of old Viet Nam.
♦ Van Lang (2876 BC – 258 BC)
At that time, the two ethnic tribes of the Lac Viet and Au Viet lived together in many areas with other inhabitants.
Based on historical documents, researchers correlatively delineated the location of Van Lang Nation to the present day regions of North and north of Central Vietnam, as well as the south of present-day Kwangsi (China).
♦ Au Lac (257 BC – 207 BC)
In 221 BC, Qin Shihuangdi (Tan Thuy Hoang), King of Qin (China), invaded the land of the Viet tribes.
Thuc Phan, the leader of the alliance of Au-Viet tribes was respected as the chief of the resistance war against the Tan enemy that later, in 208 BC, was forced to withdraw.
With his imposing power, Thuc Phan nominated himself as King An Duong Vuong and founded Au Lac Nation with groups of Lac Viet and Au Viet tribes.
In 207 BC, Trieu Da, King of Nam Viet (China), invaded Au Lac country.
The resistance of An Duong Vuong failed soon after this invasion.
As a result, the northern feudalist took turns dominating the country over the next seven centuries, establishing their harsh regime in the country and dividing the country into administrative regions and districts with unfamiliar names. However, the country’s name of Au Lac could not be erased from the people’s minds in their everyday life.
♦ Van Xuan (544-602)
In the spring of 542, Ly Bi rose up in arms and swept away the Chinese administration, liberating the territory.
He declared himself King of Van Xuan Kingdom in February 544, acknowledging the national superiority complex of the independent spirits to live in eternal peace.
However, the existence of Ly Bi’s administration was very brief. He was defeated by the Chinese imperial army, and the country returned to feudal Chinese domination again in 602.
The name Van Xuan was restored only after the victory over the Han army at the Bach Dang River led by General Ngo Quyen in 938. This victory marked the end of the Chinese domination period in Viet Nam.
♦ Dai Co Viet (968 – 1054)
In 968, Dinh Bo Linh defeated the twelve lords and unified the country. He declared himself King and named the country Dai Co Viet.
This name remained throughout the Dinh Dynasty (968-980), Pre-Le Dynasty (980-1009) and the beginning of Ly Dynasty (1010-1225).
♦ Dai Viet (1054 – 1802)
In 1054, a flaming bright star appeared in the sky for many days, which was considered a good omen. As a result, the King Ly changed the name of the country to Dai Viet. This name remained until the end of Tran Dynasty (1126 - 1400).
The name Dai Viet remained under the Le Dynasty (1428-1788) and the Tay Son Dynasty (1788-1802).
♦ Dai Ngu (1400 – 1406)
In March 1400, Ho Quy Ly usurped the throne of King Tran Thieu De, founded the Ho Dynasty and changed the country’s name to Dai Ngu, meaning peace in the ancient language.
This name only lasted for very short time, until April 1407, when the Ming enemy invaded Dai Ngu and defeated the Ho Dynasty (1400- 1407).
♦ Viet Nam
In 1802, Nguyen Anh claimed his coronation to become the first King Nguyen, starting the Nguyen dynasty and changing the country’s name to Viet Nam. This name was officially recognized in many diplomatic missions in 1804.
However, the words "Viet Nam" had already appeared very early in history.
In the 14th century, there was a book of code entitled "Viet Nam the Chi", edited by Doctor Ho Tong Thoc.
In the book by scholar Nguyen Trai entitled "Du Dia Chi" at the beginning of 15th century; the words "Viet Nam" were repeated several times.
Doctor Trinh Nguyen Binh Khiem (1491-1585) had written on the first page of his work "Trinh Tien Sinh Quoc Ngu" the following: "...
Viet Nam have constructed its foundation..." The words "Viet Nam" were also found in some carved stelae of the 16th - 17th century in Bao Lam Pagoda, Haiphong (1558), in Cam Lo Pagoda, Ha Noi (1590), in Phuc Thanh Pagoda, Bac Ninh (1664), etc.
In particular, in the first sentence on the stele Thuy Mon Dinh (1670) at the landmark on the border at Lang Son, it was written: "This is the gateway of Viet Nam that guards the northern frontiers..." 
In terms of meaning, there are many theories that prove the words "Viet Nam" are created by combining two racial and geographic elements, which is understood as "Viet people from the south".
During the reign of King Minh Mang (1820-1840), the name of the country was changed to Dai Nam, but Viet Nam was still widely used in many literary works, civil business affairs, and social relations.
Following the triumph of the August Revolution on August 19th 1945, which had entirely swept away Vietnamese feudal and French colonial oppression and began a new era in the country, President Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the nation’s independence and the national name Democratic Republic of Viet Nam was born on September 2nd 1945.
Although Viet Nam suffered from war and separation in the following 30 years, the sacred words "Viet Nam" were very popularly used from the North to the South, and were deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Vietnamese people.
Following the liberation of Southern Viet Nam on April 30 1975, the entire country of Viet Nam was completely unified.
In the first meeting of the National Assembly of the Unified Viet Nam on July 2nd 1976, the assembly decided to name the country The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.
The constitution of 1980, and 1992, continued its affirmation of the country’s official name, legally and actually.
Prehistoric Era
Prehistoric Era of Viet Nam include: Pre-Paleolithic Age and Neolithic Age.
♦ Pre-Paleolithic Age
Human civilization started in Viet Nam a very long time ago.
In fact, archaeologists have found vestiges of Homo Erectus in the caves of Lang Son and Nghe An Provinces.
During the Pre-Paleolithic Age, also known as the Son Vi Era, the population of Viet Nam was rather large and widespread.
♦ Neolithic Age
The people used sophisticated trimmed stone axes.
Foundation of the Nation
Metal Age (about 4,000 years ago):
Vietnam existed three major cultural centers: Phung Nguyen - Dong Son (The North), Long Thanh - Sa Huynh (The Centre) and Cau Sat, Doc Chua - Dong Nai (The South) from Bronze Age to Iron Age.
These three major cultural centers had close and long mutual relationship, contributed to specific traditional culture of Viet Nam.
It's unity in abundance.
♦ Van Lang Nation
Hung Vuong Museum (Phu Tho Province)
♦ Au Lac Nation
A few centuries later, An Duong Vuong founded the Au Lac Nation in the third century BC.
Records of this nation can be found in the annals written by the Chinese historian, Xi Ma Tin.
Remains of the Co Loa Citadel, which was built during the An Duong Vuong period, can still be seen today.
Co Loa Ancient Citadel (Ha Noi)
♦ Champa Nation
The Pre-Sa Huynh culture evolved in South Central Viet Nam during the Iron Age.
The people of this group lived between Thua Thien and the Dong Nai River Delta.
The Sa Huynh culture was founded by the ancestors of the Cham who founded the Champa Kingdom.

There are two main streams of them: the Dao Quan Chet (close-fitting-trousered) group (alternatively Dao Chit (close-fit) or Dao Nga Hoang), and Dao Deo Tien (coin-bearing) group (or just Dao Tien (coin)).
Each group has its own forms of belief-action, yet generally they all reflect same given values.
According to Dao’s custom, a man performed “Cap Sac” will be considered as a mature man, no matter how old he is. He, therefore, can take part in important business of the village, can give the sorcerer a hand, can make ceremonial offerings, and becomes the true off-spring of the Ban King.
The Cap Sac ritual is normally held at the end of the year.
It lasts 2-3 days with two main ceremonies namely Trinh Dien (presentation) and Thu Den (light-receiving).
Within a family, Cap Sac ritual goes in the order of generations: father to sons, older brothers to younger ones.
After Cap Sac, the receiver of the ritual will be given a religious name, lunar name, and a set of moral principles specifying 10 prohibited actions and 10 encouraged ones admonishing of moral philosophy, executing good deeds, avoiding bad and malicious ones, leading a responsible life towards one’s family and society, living in harmony with mother nature, conserving traditional customs and habits, etc..
Mention of Cap Sac reminds its special activities of Mua Chuong (Bell-dancing), Doi Den (Carrying lights on head), Pao Dung singing, etc.

The stable conservation of Dao people’s life in Phu Tho through thousands of years is the most persuasive evidence of Cap Sac’s value in functioning as a culture and belief action, a space for community life, a chance to educate youngsters of traditions and culture of the ethnic group.
It also plays as a multi-aspect picture genuinely reflecting their life, which, therefore, makes significant contributions to intangible cultural treasure of motherland Phu Tho and needs to be nurtured and preserved.

Update:
Views:
The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism has ratified Ninh Thuan provincial People’s Committee’s proposal on compiling a dossier on Cham ethnic pottery to secure UNESCO’s recognition as an intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding.
The Ministry noted that during the planning and documenting process, Ninh Thuan provincial Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Viet Nam National Institute of Culture and Arts Studies - Ho Chi Minh city branch have to conduct surveys, study and invite localities with Cham ethnic traditional pottery to participate.
One of the outstanding characteristics of the Cham ethnic traditional pottery making is the technique of making pottery without turntables, and open firing with straw and fire-wood. They are unique products bearing many cultural history marks of the ethnic minority group. Cham ethnic people use their skilled hands to create a variety of products in different designs, serving the needs of daily activities, beliefs and religions, while expressing the creativity and cultural identity of the Cham ethnic group. They include water containers, rice containers, reliefs, decorative lamps, statues of Apsara and Shiva.
Pottery traditional crafts of Cham ethnic group in Binh Thuan and the arts of pottery making of Cham ethnic group in Bau Truc village, Phuoc Dan town, Ninh Phuoc District, Ninh Thuan Province were recognized as national intangible cultural heritages.
